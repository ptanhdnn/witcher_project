       "toothed palisade which had obviously not been worth dismantling and moving. As far away as \n",

       "in his black coat, he sat down on the floor. There were no chairs in the chamber, or in the rest \n",
       "of the palace. \n",
       "\n",
       "He sat motionless, his eyes closed. His breathing, at first even, suddenly quickened, became \n",
       "rasping and tense. And then stopped completely. The mixture which helped the witcher gain \n",
       "full control of his body was chiefly made up of veratrum, stramonium, hawthorn and spurge. \n",
       "The other ingredients had no name in any human language. For anyone who was not, like \n",
       "Geralt, inured to it from childhood, it would have been lethal poison. \n",

       "easily picked out a rustle of footsteps through the courtyard overgrown with stinging nettles. \n",
       "It could not be the striga. The steps were too light. Geralt threw his sword across his back, hid \n",
       "his bundle in the hearth of the ruined chimney-place and, silent as a bat, ran downstairs. \n",
       "\n",
       "It was still light enough in the courtyard for the approaching man to see the witcher's face. \n",
       "The man, Ostrit, backed away abruptly; an involuntary grimace of terror and repulsion \n",
       "contorted his lips. The witcher smiled wryly - he knew what he looked like. After drinking a \n",
       "mixture of banewart, monk's hood and eyebright the face takes on the colour of chalk, and the \n",
       "pupils fill the entire iris. But the mixture enables one to see in the deepest darkness, and this is \n",

       "away, changing the direction of his spin with a fluttering pirouette to confuse the striga. As he \n",

       "\n",

       "The witcher smiled maliciously. His first attempt, as he had hoped, had gone well. Silver was \n",
       "fatal to the striga, as it was for most monsters brought into existence through magic. So there \n",
       "was a chance: the beast was like the others, and that boded well for lifting the spell, while the \n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The striga was in no hurry with her next attack. She approached slowly, baring her fangs, \n",

       "By slowing and quickening his movements he distracted the striga, making it difficult for her \n",

       "\n",
       "The moment the striga tensed and leapt the chain whistled through the air and, coiling like a \n",
       "snake, twined itself around the monster's shoulders, neck and head. The striga's jump became \n",
       "a tumble, and she let out an ear-piercing whistle. She thrashed around on the floor, howling \n",
       "horribly with fury or from the burning pain inflicted by the despised metal. Geralt was content \n",
       "- if he wanted he could kill the striga without great difficulty. But the witcher did not draw his \n",
       "sword. Nothing in the striga's behaviour had given him reason to think she might be an \n",
       "incurable case. Geralt moved to a safer distance and, without letting the writhing shape on the \n",
       "floor out of his sight, breathed deeply, focused himself. \n",
       "\n",
       "The chain snapped. The silver links scattered like rain in all directions, ringing against the \n",
       "stone. The striga, blind with fury, tumbled to the attack, roaring. Geralt waited calmly and, \n",
       "with his raised right hand, traced the Sign of Aard in front of him. \n",
       "\n",
       "The striga fell back as if hit by a mallet but kept her feet, extended her talons, bared her fangs. \n",
       "Her hair stood on end and fluttered as if she were walking against a fierce wind. With \n",
       "difficulty, one rasping step at a time, she slowly advanced. But she did advance. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt grew uneasy. He did not expect such a simple Sign to paralyse the striga entirely but \n",
       "neither did he expect the beast to overcome it so easily. He could not hold the Sign for long, it \n",
       "was too exhausting, and the striga had no more than ten steps to go. He lowered the Sign \n",
       "suddenly, and sprung aside. The striga, taken by surprise, flew forward, lost her balance, fell, \n",
       "slid along the floor and tumbled down the stairs into the crypt's entrance, yawning in the floor. \n",
       "\n",
       "Her infernal scream reverberated from below. \n",
       "\n",
       "To gain time Geralt jumped on to the stairs leading to the \n",
       "\n",
       "gallery. He had not even climbed halfway up when the striga ran out of the crypt, speeding \n",
       "along like an enormous black spider. The witcher waited until she had run up the stairs after \n",
       "him, then leapt over the balustrade. The striga turned on the stairs, sprang and flew at him in \n",
       "an amazing ten-metre leap. She did not let herself be deceived by his pirouettes this time; \n",
       "twice her talons left their mark on the Rivian's leather tunic. But another desperately hard \n",
       "blow from the silver spiked gauntlet threw the striga aside, shook her. Geralt, feeling fury \n",
       "building inside him, swayed, bent backwards and, with a mighty kick, knocked the beast off \n",
       "her legs. \n",
       "\n",
       "The roar she gave was louder than all the previous ones. Even the plaster crumbled from the \n",
       "ceiling. \n",
       "\n",
       "The striga sprang up, shaking with uncontrolled anger and lust for murder. Geralt waited. He \n",
       "drew his sword, traced circles with it in the air, and skirted the striga, taking care that the \n",
       "movement of his sword was not in rhythm with his steps. The striga did not jump. She \n",
       "approached slowly, following the bright streak of the blade with her eyes. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt stopped abruptly, froze with his sword raised. The striga, disconcerted, also stopped. \n",
       "The witcher traced a slow semi-circle with the blade, took a step in the striga's direction. Then \n",
       "another. Then he leapt, feigning a whirling movement with his sword above her head. \n",
       "\n",
       "The striga curled up, retreated in a zigzag. Geralt was close again, the blade shimmering in his \n",
       "hand. His eyes lit up with an ominous glow, a hoarse roar tore through his clenched teeth. The \n",
       "striga backed away, pushed by the power of concentrated hatred, anger and violence which \n",
       "emanated from the attacking man and struck her in waves, penetrating her mind and body. \n",
       "Terrified and pained by feelings unknown to her she let out a thin, shaking squeak, turned on \n",
       "the spot and ran off in a desperate, crazy escape down the dark tangle of the palace's \n",
       "corridors. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt stood quivering in the middle of the hall. Alone. It had taken a long time, he thought, \n",
       "before this dance on the edge of an abyss, this mad, macabre ballet of a fight, had achieved \n",
       "the desired effect, allowed him to psychically become one with his opponent, \n",
       "\n",
       "to reach the underlayers of concentrated will which permeated the striga. The evil, twisted \n",
       "will from which the striga was born. The witcher shivered at the memory of taking on that \n",
       "evil to redirect it, as if in a mirror, against the monster. Never before had he come across such \n",
       "a concentration of hatred and murderous frenzy, not even from basilisks, who enjoyed a \n",
       "ferocious reputation for it. \n",
       "\n",
       "All the better, he thought as he walked toward the crypt entrance and the blackness that spread \n",
       "from it like an enormous puddle. All the better, all the stronger, was the blow received by the \n",
       "striga. This would give him a little more time until the beast recovered from the shock. The \n",
       "witcher doubted whether he could repeat such an effort. The elixirs were weakening and it \n",
       "was still a long time until dawn. But the striga could not return to her crypt before first light, \n",
       "or all his trouble would come to nothing. \n",
       "\n",
       "He went down the stairs. The crypt was not large; there was room for three stone sarcophagi. \n",
       "The slab covering the first was half pushed aside. Geralt pulled the third vial from beneath his \n",
       "tunic, quickly drank its contents, climbed into the tomb and stretched out in it. As he had \n",
       "expected, it was a double tomb -for mother and daughter. \n",
       "\n",
       "He had only just pulled the cover closed when he heard the striga's roar again. He lay on his \n",
       "back next to Adda's mummified corpse and traced the Sign of Yrden on the inside of the slab. \n",
       "He laid his sword on his chest, stood a tiny hourglass filled with phosphorescent sand next to \n",
       "it and crossed his arms. He no longer heard the striga's screams as she searched the palace. He \n",
       "had gradually stopped hearing anything as the true-love and celandine began to work. \n",

       "His senses were now functioning normally. \n",
       "\n",
       "He took hold of his sword and, murmuring an incantation, ran his hand across the lid of the \n",
       "sarcophagus. He then moved the slab slightly, a couple of inches. \n",
       "\n",
       "Silence. \n",
       "\n",
       "He pushed the lid further, sat, holding his weapon at the ready, and lifted his head above the \n",
       "tomb. The crypt was dark but the witcher knew that outside dawn was breaking. He struck a \n",
       "light, lit a miniature lamp and lifted it, throwing strange shadows across the walls of the crypt. \n",
       "\n",
       "It was empty. \n",
       "\n",
       "He scrambled from the sarcophagus, aching, numb, cold. And then he saw her. She was lying \n",
       "on her back next to the tomb, naked and unconscious. \n",
       "\n",
       "She was rather ugly. Slim with small pointed breasts, and dirty. Her hair - flaxen-red - reached \n",
       "almost to her waist. Standing the lamp on the slab he knelt beside her and leant over. Her lips \n",
       "were pale and her face was bloody where he had hit her cheekbone. Geralt removed his \n",
       "gloves, put his sword aside and, without any fuss, drew up her top lip with his finger. Her \n",
       "teeth were normal. He reached for her hand which was buried in her tangled hair. Before he \n",
       "took it he saw her open eyes. Too late. \n",
       "\n",
       "She swiped him across the neck with her talons, cutting him deeply. Blood splashed on to her \n",
       "face. She howled, striking him in the eyes with her other hand. He fell on her, grabbing her by \n",
       "the wrists, nailing her to the floor. She gnashed her teeth - which were now too short - in \n",
       "front of his face. He butted her in the face with his forehead and pinned her down harder. She \n",
       "had lost her former strength; she could only writhe beneath him, howling, spitting out blood - \n",
       "his blood - which was pouring over her mouth. His blood was draining away quickly. There \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "was no time. The witcher cursed and bit her hard on the neck, just below the ear. He dug his \n",
       "teeth in and clenched them until her inhuman howling became a thin, despairing scream and \n",
       "then a choking sob - the cry of a hurt fourteen-year-old girl. \n",
       "\n",
       "He let her go when she stopped moving, got to his knees, tore a piece of canvas from his \n",
       "sleeve pocket and pressed it to his neck. He felt for his sword, held the blade to the \n",
       "unconscious girl's throat, and leant over her hand. The nails were dirty, broken, bloodied but . \n",

       "\n",
       "The witcher got up with difficulty. The sticky-wet greyness of early morning was flooding in \n",
       "through the crypt's entrance. He made a move towards the stairs but staggered and sat down \n",
       "heavily on the floor. Blood was pouring through the drenched canvas onto his hands, running \n",
       "down his sleeve. He unfastened his tunic, slit his shirt, tore and ripped rags from it and tied \n",
       "them around his neck, knowing that he didn't have much time, that he would soon faint . . . \n",

       "enormous. The smile - if it had been a smile - vanished from her face as though wiped away \n",
       "with a cloth. Geralt took another stepf, the leaves rustled underfoot, and the girl ran down the \n",
       "slope like a deer, flitting between the hazel bushes. She was no more than a white streak as \n",
       "she disappeared into the depths of the forest. The long dress didn't appear to restrict her ease \n",
       "of movement in the least. \n",
       "\n",
       "Roach neighed anxiously, tossing her head. Geralt, still watching the forest, instinctively \n",
       "calmed her with the Sign again. Pulling the mare by the bridle he walked slowly along the \n",
       "wall, wading through burdock up to the waist. \n",
       "\n",
       "He came to a sturdy gate, with iron fittings and rusty hinges, furnished with a great brass \n",
       "knocker. After a moment's hesitation Geralt reached out and touched the tarnished ring. He \n",
       "immediately jumped back as, at that moment, the gate opened, squeaking, clattering, and \n",
       "raking aside clumps of grass, stones and branches. There was no one behind it - the witcher \n",
       "could only see a deserted courtyard, neglected and overgrown with nettles. He entered, \n",
       "leading Roach. The mare, still stunned by the Sign, didn't resist, but she moved stiffly and \n",
       "hesitantly after him. \n",
       "\n",
       "The courtyard was surrounded on three sides by a wall and the remains of some wooden \n",
       "scaffolding. On the fourth side stood the mansion, its facade mottled by a pox of chipped \n",
       "plaster, dirty damp patches, and festooned with ivy. The shutters, with their peeling paint, \n",
       "were closed, as was the door. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt threw Roach's reins over the pillar by the gate and slowly made his way towards the \n",
       "mansion, following the gravel path past a small fountain full of leaves and rubbish. In the \n",
       "centre of the \n",
       "\n",
       "fountain, on a fanciful plinth, a white stone dolphin arched, turning its chipped tail upwards. \n",
       "\n",
       "Next to the fountain in what, a very long time ago, used to be a flowerbed, grew a rosebush. \n",
       "Nothing but the colour of the flowers made this bush unique - but the flowers were \n",
       "exceptional: indigo, with a faint shade of purple on the tips of some of the petals. The witcher \n",
       "touched one, brought his face closer and inhaled. The flowers held the typical scent of roses, \n",
       "only a little more intense. \n",
       "\n",
       "The door and all the shutters of the mansion flew open at the same instant with a bang. Geralt \n",
       "raised his head abruptly. Down the path, scrunching the gravel, a monster was rushing straight \n",
       "at him. \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher's right hand rose, as fast as lightning, above his right shoulder while his left \n",
       "jerked the belt across his chest making the sword hilt jump into his palm. The blade, leaping \n",
       "from the scabbard with a hiss, traced a short, luminous semi-circle and froze, the point aiming \n",
       "at the charging beast. \n",
       "\n",
       "At the sight of the sword the monster stopped short, spraying gravel in all directions. The \n",
       "witcher didn't even flinch. \n",
       "\n",
       "The creature was humanoid, and dressed in clothes which, though tattered, were of good \n",
       "quality and not lacking in stylish and useless ornamentation. His human form, however, \n",
       "reached no higher than the soiled collar of his tunic, for above it loomed a gigantic, hairy, \n",
       "bear-like head with enormous ears, a pair of wild eyes and terrifying jaws full of crooked \n",
       "fangs in which a red tongue flickered like flame. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Flee, mortal man!' the monster roared, flapping his paws but not moving from the spot. Til \n",
       "devour you! Tear you to pieces!' The witcher didn't move, didn't lower his sword. 'Are you \n",
       "deaf? Away with you!' The creature screamed, then made a sound somewhere between a pig's \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "squeal and a stag's bellowing roar, making the shutters rattle and clatter and shaking rubble \n",
       "and plaster from the sills. Neither witcher nor monster moved. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Clear off while you're still in one piece!' roared the creature, less sure of himself. 'Because if \n",
       "you don't, then-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Then what?' interrupted Geralt. \n",
       "\n",
       "The monster suddenly gasped and tilted his monstrous head. 'Look at him, isn't he brave?' He \n",
       "spoke calmly, baring his fangs and glowering at Geralt with bloodshot eyes. 'Lower that iron, \n",
       "if you please. Perhaps you've not realised you're in my courtyard? Or maybe it's customary, \n",
       "wherever you come from, to threaten people with swords in their own courtyards?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'It is customary,' Geralt agreed, 'when faced with people who greet their guests with a roar and \n",
       "the cry that they're going to tear you to pieces.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Pox on it!' The monster got himself worked up. 'And he'll insult me on top of it all, this \n",
       "straggler. A guest, is he? Pushes his way into the yard, ruins someone else's flowers, plays the \n",
       "lord and thinks that he'll be brought bread and salt. Bah!' \n",
       "\n",
       "The creature spat, gasped and shut his jaws. The lower fangs protruded, making him look like \n",
       "a boar. \n",
       "\n",
       "'So?' The witcher spoke after a moment, lowering his sword. 'Are we going to carry on \n",
       "standing like this?' \n",
       "\n",
       "And what do you suggest instead? Lying down?' snorted the monster. 'Put that iron away, I \n",
       "said.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher nimbly slipped the weapon into its scabbard and, without lowering his arm, \n",
       "stroked the hilt which rose above his shoulder. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I'd prefer you,' he said, 'not to make any sudden moves. This sword can always be drawn \n",
       "again, faster than you imagine.' \n",
       "\n",
       "\"I noticed,' rasped the monster. 'If it wasn't for that you'd have been out of this gate a long \n",
       "time ago, with my bootprint on your arse. What do you want here? How did you get here?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I got lost,' lied the witcher. \n",
       "\n",
       "'You got lost,' repeated the monster, twisting his jaws in a menacing grin. 'Well, unlose your \n",
       "way. Out of the gate, turn your left ear to the sun and keep walking and you'll soon get back to \n",
       "the highway. Well? What are you waiting for?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Is there any water?' asked Geralt calmly. 'The horse is thirsty. And so am I, if that doesn't \n",
       "inconvenience you.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The monster shifted from one foot to the other and scratched \n",
       "\n",
       "his ear. 'Listen you,' he said. 'Are you really not frightened of me?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Should I be?' \n",
       "\n",
       "The monster looked around, cleared his throat and yanked up his baggy trousers. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Pox on it, what's the harm of a guest in the house? It's not every day I meet someone who \n",
       "doesn't run away or faint at the sight of me. All right then. If you're a weary but honest \n",
       "wanderer I invite you in. But if you're a brigand or a thief, then I warn you: this house does \n",
       "what I tell it to. Within these walls I rule!' \n",
       "\n",
       "He lifted his hairy paw. All the shutters clattered against the wall once more and deep in the \n",
       "dolphin's stone gullet something rumbled. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I invite you in,' he repeated. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt didn't move, scrutinising him. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Do you live alone?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What's that to do with you?' said the monster angrily, opening his jaws, then croaked loudly, \n",
       "'Oh, I see. No doubt you'd like to know whether I've got forty servants all as beautiful as me. I \n",
       "don't. Well, pox, are you going to make use of my generous invitation? If not, the gate's over \n",
       "there.' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt bowed stiffly. 'I accept your invitation,' he said formally. 'I won't slight the right of \n",
       "hospitality.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'My house is your house,' the monster said in return, just as formally, although a little \n",
       "offhandedly. 'This way please, dear guest. And leave the horse here, by the well.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The interior was in need of extensive repair, although it was reasonably clean and tidy. The \n",
       "furniture had been made by skilled craftsmen, if a very long time ago. A pungent smell of dust \n",
       "hung in the dark rooms. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Light!' growled the monster, and the torch in its iron bracket burst into flames and sooty \n",
       "smoke. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Not bad,' remarked the witcher. \n",
       "\n",
       "The monster cackled. 'That's it? I see you won't be amazed by any old trick. I told you this \n",
       "house obeys my commands. This way, please. Careful, the stairs are steep. Light!' \n",
       "\n",
       "On the stairs, the monster turned. 'What's that around your neck, dear guest?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Have a look.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The creature took the medallion in his paw, lifted it up to his eyes, tightening the chain around \n",
       "Geralt's neck a little. \n",
       "\n",
       "'The animal has an unpleasant expression. What is it?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'My guild's badge.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Ah, you make muzzles, no doubt. This way, please. Light!' \n",
       "\n",
       "The centre of the large room, completely devoid of windows, was taken up by a huge oak \n",
       "table, empty apart from an enormous brass candlestick, slowly turning green and covered with \n",
       "trickles of hardened wax. At the monster's command the candles lit and flickered, brightening \n",
       "the interior a little. \n",
       "\n",
       "One wall was hung with weapons, compositions of round shields, crossed partisans, javelins \n",
       "and guisarmes, heavy sabres and axes. Half of the adjacent wall was taken up by an enormous \n",
       "fireplace, above which hung rows of flaking and peeling portraits. The wall facing the \n",
       "entrance was filled with hunting trophies - elks and stag antlers whose branching racks threw \n",
       "long shadows across the grinning mounted heads of wild boar, bear and lynx, over the ruffled \n",
       "and frayed wings of eagles and hawks. The place of honour was filled by a rock dragon's \n",
       "head, tainted brown, damaged and leaking stuffing. Geralt examined it more closely. \n",
       "\n",
       "'My grandpa killed it,' said the monster, throwing a huge log into the depths of the fireplace. \n",
       "'It was probably the last one in the vicinity when it got itself killed. Sit, my dear guest. You're \n",
       "hungry?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I won't deny it, dear host.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The monster sat at the table, lowered his head, clasped his hairy paws over his stomach, \n",
       "muttered something while twiddling his enormous thumbs, then suddenly roared, thumping \n",
       "the table with his paw. Dishes and platters rattled like pewter and silver, chalices jingled like \n",
       "crystal. There was a smell of roast meat, garlic, marjoram and nutmeg. Geralt did not show \n",
       "any surprise. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Yes.' The monster rubbed his hands. 'This is better than servants, isn't it? Help yourself, dear \n",
       "guest. Here is some fowl, \n",
       "\n",
       "here some boar ham, here terrine of ... I don't know what. Something. Here we have some \n",
       "hazel grouse. Pox, no, it's partridge. I got the spells muddled up. Eat up, eat up. This is proper, \n",
       "real food, don't worry.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I'm not worried.' Geralt tore the fowl in two. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I forgot,' snorted the monster, 'that you're not timid. What shall I call you?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Geralt. And your name, dear host?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Nivellen. But they call me Degen or Fanger around here. And they use me to frighten \n",
       "children.' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The monster poured the contents of an enormous chalice down his throat, after which he sank \n",
       "his fingers in the terrine, tearing half of it from the bowl in one go. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Frighten children,' repeated Geralt with his mouth full. 'Without any reason, no doubt?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Of course not. Your health, Geralt!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And yours, Nivellen.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'How's the wine? Have you noticed that it's made from grapes and not apples? But if you don't \n",
       "like it I'll conjure up a different one.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Thank you, it's not bad. Are your magical powers innate?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'No. I've had them since growing this. This trap, that is. I don't know how it happened myself, \n",
       "but the house does whatever I wish. Nothing very big; I can conjure up food, drink, clothes, \n",
       "clean linen, hot water, soap. Any woman can do that, and without using magic at that. I can \n",
       "open and close windows and doors. I can light a fire. Nothing very remarkable.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'It's something. And this . . . trap, as you call it, have you had it long?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Twelve years.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'How did it happen?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What's it got to do with you? Pour yourself some more wine.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'With pleasure. It's got nothing to do with me. I'm just asking out of curiosity.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'An acceptable reason,' the monster said, and laughed loudly. 'But I don't accept it. It's got \n",
       "nothing to do with you and that's \n",
       "\n",
       "that. But just to satisfy your curiosity a little I'll show you what I used to look like. Look at \n",
       "those portraits. The first from the chimney is my father. The second, pox only knows. And the \n",
       "third is me. Can you see it?' \n",
       "\n",
       "Beneath the dust and spider-webs a nondescript man with a bloated, sad, spotty face and \n",
       "watery eyes looked down from the painting. Geralt, who was no stranger to the way portrait \n",
       "painters tended to flatter their clients, nodded. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Can you see it?' repeated Nivellen, baring his fangs. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I can.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Who are you?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I don't understand.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You don't understand?' The monster raised his head; his eyes shone like a cat's. 'My portrait is \n",
       "hung beyond the candlelight. I can see it, but I'm not human. At least, not at the moment. A \n",
       "human, looking at my portrait, would get up, go closer and, no doubt, have to take the \n",
       "candlestick with him. You didn't do that, so the conclusion is simple. But I'm asking you \n",
       "plainly: are you human?' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt didn't lower his eyes. 'If that's the way you put it,' he answered after a moment's \n",
       "silence, 'then, not quite.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Ah. Surely it won't be tactless if I ask, in that case, what you are?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A witcher.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Ah,' Nivellen repeated after a moment. 'If I remember rightly, witchers earn their living in an \n",
       "interesting way - they kill monsters for money.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You remember correctly.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Silence fell again. Candle flames pulsated, flicked upwards in thin wisps of fire, glimmering \n",
       "in the cut-crystal chalices. Cascades of wax trickled down the candlestick. \n",
       "\n",
       "Nivellen sat still, lightly twitching his enormous ears. 'Let's assume,' he said finally, 'that you \n",
       "draw your sword before I jump on you. Let's assume you even manage to cut me down. With \n",
       "my weight, that won't stop me; I'll take you down through sheer momentum. And then it's \n",
       "teeth that'll decide. What do you think, \n",
       "\n",
       "witcher, which one of us has a better chance if it comes to biting each other's throats?' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt, steadying the carafe's pewter stopper with his thumb, poured himself some wine, took \n",
       "a sip and leaned back into his chair. He was watching the monster with a smile. An \n",
       "exceptionally ugly one. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Yeeees,' said Nivellen slowly, digging at the corner of his jaws with his claw. 'One has to \n",
       "admit you can answer questions without using many words. It'll be interesting to see how you \n",
       "manage the next one. Who paid you to deal with me?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'No one. I'm here by accident.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You're not lying, by any chance?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I'm not in the habit of lying.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And what are you in the habit of doing? I've heard about witchers - they abduct tiny \n",
       "children whom they feed with magic herbs. The ones who survive become witchers \n",
       "themselves, sorcerers with inhuman powers. They're taught to kill, and all human feelings and \n",
       "reactions are trained out of them. They're turned into monsters in order to kill other monsters. \n",
       "I've heard it said it's high time someone started hunting witchers, as there are fewer and fewer \n",
       "monsters and more and more witchers. Do have some partridge before it's completely cold.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Nivellen took the partridge from the dish, put it between his jaws and crunched it like a piece \n",
       "of toast, bones cracking as they were crushed between his teeth. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Why don't you say anything?' he asked indistinctly, swallowing. 'How much of the rumours \n",
       "about you witchers is true?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Practically nothing.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And what's a lie?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That there are fewer and fewer monsters.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'True. There's a fair number of them.' Nivellen bared his fangs. 'One is sitting in front of you \n",
       "wondering if he did the right thing by inviting you in. I didn't like your guild badge right from \n",
       "the start, dear guest.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You aren't a monster, Nivellen,' the witcher said dryly. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Pox, that's something new. So what am I? Cranberry pudding? \n",
       "\n",
       "A flock of wild geese flying south on a sad November morning? No? Maybe I'm the virtue \n",
       "that a miller's buxom daughter lost in spring? Well, Geralt, tell me what I am. Gan't you see \n",
       "I'm shaking with curiosity?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You're not a monster. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to touch this silver tray. And in no way \n",
       "could you hold my medallion.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Ha!' Nivellen roared so powerfully the candle flames fell horizontal for a moment. 'Today, \n",
       "very clearly, is a day for revealing great and terrible secrets! Now I'm going to be told that I \n",
       "grew these ears because I didn't like milky porridge as a child!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'No, Nivellen,' said Geralt calmly. 'It happened because of a spell. I'm sure you know who cast \n",
       "that spell.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And what if I do?' \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "'I can. Do you want me to try?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'No. I don't.' The monster opened his jaws and poked out his tongue, two span long, and very \n",
       "red. 'Surprised you, hasn't it?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That it has,' admitted Geralt. \n",
       "\n",
       "The monster giggled and lounged in his armchair. 'I knew that would,' he said. 'Pour yourself \n",
       "some more, get comfortable and I'll tell you the whole story. Witcher or not, you've got an \n",
       "honest face and I feel like talking. Pour yourself more.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'There's none left.' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'Pox on it!' The monster cleared his throat, then thumped the table with his paw again. A large \n",
       "earthenware demijohn in a wicker basket appeared next to the two empty carafes, from \n",
       "nowhere. Nivellen tore the sealing wax off with his teeth. \n",
       "\n",
       "As no doubt you've noticed,' he began, pouring the wine, 'this is quite a remote area. It's a \n",
       "long way to the nearest human settlement. It's because, you see, my father, and my \n",
       "grandfather too, in his time, didn't make themselves particularly loved by our neighbours or \n",
       "the merchants using the highway. If anyone went astray here and my father spotted them from \n",
       "the tower, they lost -at best - their fortune. And a couple of the nearer settlements \n",
       "\n",
       "were burnt because Father decided the levies were being paid tardily. Not many people liked \n",
       "my father. Except for me, naturally. I cried awfully when what was left of my father after a \n",
       "blow from a two-handed sword was brought home on a cart one day. Grandpa didn't take part \n",
       "in robbery any more because, ever since he was hit on the head with a morningstar, he had a \n",
       "terrible stutter. He dribbled and rarely made it to the privy on time. As their heir, I had to lead \n",
       "the gang. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I was young at the time,' Nivellen continued, 'a real milksop, so the lads in the crew wound \n",
       "me around their little fingers in a flash. I was as much in command of them as a fat piglet is of \n",
       "a pack of wolves. We soon began doing things which Father would never have allowed, had \n",
       "he been alive. I'll spare you the details and get straight to the point. One day we took \n",
       "ourselves as far as Gelibol, near Mirt, and robbed a temple. A young priestess was there too.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Which temple, Nivellen?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Pox only knows, but it must have been a bad one. There were skulls and bones on the altar, I \n",
       "remember, and a green fire was burning. It stank like nobody's business. But to the point. The \n",
       "lads overpowered the priestess and stripped her, then said I had to become a man. Well, I \n",
       "became a man, stupid little snot that I was, and while I was achieving manhood the priestess \n",
       "spat into my face and screamed something.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That I was a monster in human skin, that I'd be a monster in a monster's skin, something \n",
       "about love, blood ... I can't remember. She must have had the dagger, a little one, hidden in \n",
       "her hair. She killed herself and then- \n",
       "\n",
       "'We fled from there, Geralt, I'm telling you - we nearly wore our horses out. It was a bad \n",

       "\n",
       "'Go on.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Then it was as the priestess had said. A few days later, I woke up and as the servants saw me, \n",
       "they screamed and took to their heels. I went to the mirror . . . You see, Geralt, I panicked, \n",
       "had some sort of an attack, I remember it almost \n",
       "\n",
       "through a haze. To put it briefly, corpses fell. Several. I used whatever came to hand - and I'd \n",
       "suddenly become very strong. And the house helped as best it could: doors slammed, furniture \n",
       "flew in the air, fires broke out. Whoever could get out ran away in a-panic: my aunt and \n",
       "cousin, the lads from the crew. What am I saying? Even the dogs howled and cowered. My \n",
       "cat, Glutton, ran away. Even my aunt's parrot kicked the bucket out of fear. I was alone, \n",
       "roaring, howling, going mad, smashing whatever came to hand, mainly mirrors.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Nivellen paused, sighed and sniffed. . \n",
       "\n",
       "'When the attack was over,' he resumed after a while, 'it was already too late. I was alone. I \n",
       "couldn't explain to anyone that only my appearance had changed, that although in this horrible \n",
       "shape I was just a stupid youngster, sobbing over the servants' bodies in an empty manor. I \n",
       "was afraid they'd come back and kill me before I could explain. But nobody returned.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The monster grew silent for a moment and wiped his nose on his sleeve. 'I don't want to go \n",
       "back to those first months, Geralt. It still leaves me shaking when I recall them. I'll get to the \n",
       "point. For a long time, a very long time, I sat in the manor, quiet as a mouse, not stirring from \n",
       "the place. If anyone appeared, which rarely happened, I wouldn't go out. I'd tell the house to \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "slam the shutters a couple of times, or I'd roar through the gargoyle, and that was usually \n",
       "enough for the would-be guest to leave in a hurry. So that's how it was, until one day I looked \n",
       "out of the window one pale dawn and - what did I see? Some trespasser stealing a rose from \n",
       "my aunt's bush. And it isn't just any old rosebush: these are blue roses from Nazair. It was \n",
       "Grandfather who brought the seedlings. I flew into a fury and jumped outside. \n",
       "\n",
       "'The fat trespasser, when he got his voice back - he'd lost it when he saw me - squealed that \n",
       "he only wanted a few flowers for his daughter, that I should spare him, spare his life and his \n",
       "health. I was just ready to kick him out of the main gate when I remembered something. \n",
       "Stories Lenka, my nanny - the old bag used to tell me. Pox on it, I thought, if pretty girls turn \n",
       "frogs into princes, or the other way round, then maybe . . . Maybe there's a \n",
       "\n",
       "grain of truth in these stories, a chance ... I leapt four yards, roared so loud wild vine tumbled \n",
       "from the wall, and I yelled \"Your daughter or your life!\" Nothing better came to mind. The \n",
       "merchant, for he was a merchant, began to weep, then confessed that his daughter was only \n",
       "eight. Are you laughing?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'No.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I didn't know whether to laugh or cry over my shitty fate. I felt sorry for the old trader. I \n",
       "couldn't watch him shake like that. I invited him inside, made him welcome and, when he was \n",
       "leaving I poured gold and precious stones into his bag. There was still a fair fortune in the \n",
       "cellar from Father's day. I hadn't quite known what to do with it, so I could allow myself this \n",
       "gesture. The merchant beamed and thanked me so profusely that he slobbered all over \n",
       "himself. He must have boasted about his adventure somewhere because not two weeks had \n",
       "gone by when another merchant appeared. He had a pretty large bag ready with him. And a \n",
       "daughter. Also pretty large.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Nivellen extended his legs under the table and stretched until the armchair creaked. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I came to an understanding with the merchant in no time,' he continued. 'He'd leave her with \n",
       "me for a year. I had to help him load the sack onto his mule; he wouldn't have managed by \n",

       "were eating at the same table, chatting and going for long walks. She was kind, and \n",
       "remarkably smart, and I'd get tongue-tied when I talked to her. You see, Geralt, I was always \n",
       "shy with girls, always made a laughing stock of myself, even with wenches from the cowshed \n",
       "with dung up to their knees, girls the lads from the crew turned over this way and that at will. \n",
       "Even they made fun of me. To say nothing of having a maw like this. I couldn't even make \n",
       "myself say anything about why I had paid so dearly for a year of her life. The year dragged \n",

       "several months to any of the guests who turned up with daughters. But after a year spent with \n",
       "company, I realised how hard it was to live without anyone to talk to.' The monster made a \n",
       "noise which was supposed to be a sigh but came out more like a hiccough. \n",
       "\n",
       "'The next one,' he said after a while, 'was called Fenne. She was small, bright and chirpy, a \n",
       "real goldcrest. She wasn't frightened of me at all. Once, on the anniversary of my first haircut, \n",
       "my coming of age, we'd both drunk too much mead and ... ha, ha. Straight after, I jumped out \n",
       "of bed and ran to the mirror. I must admit I was disappointed, and despondent. The trap was \n",
       "the same as it ever was, if with a slightly more stupid expression. And they say the wisdom of \n",
       "ages is to be found in fairy tales. It's not worth a shit, wisdom like that, Geralt. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Well, Fenne quickly tried to make me forget my worries. She was a jolly girl, I tell you. Do \n",
       "you know what she thought up? We'd both frighten unwanted guests. Imagine: a guest like \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "that enters the courtyard, looks around, and then, with a roar, I charge at him on all fours with \n",
       "Fenne, completely naked, sitting on my back and blowing my grandfather's hunting horn!' \n",
       "\n",
       "Nivellen shook with laughter, the white of his fangs flashing. 'Fenne,' he continued, 'stayed \n",

       "'All right. The next one, Primula, was the daughter of an impoverished knight. The knight, \n",
       "when he got here, had a skinny horse, a rusty cuirass and incredible debts. He was as hideous \n",
       "as cow dung, I tell you, Geralt, and spread a similar smell. Primula, I'd wager my right hand, \n",
       "was conceived while he was at war, as she was quite pretty. I didn't frighten her either, which \n",
       "isn't surprising, really, as compared to her parent I might have appeared quite comely. She \n",
       "had, as it turned out, quite a temperament and I, having gained some self-confidence, seized \n",
       "the moment by the horns. After two weeks Primula and I already \n",
       "\n",
       "had a very close relationship. She liked to pull me by the ears and shout \"Bite me to death, \n",
       "you animal!\" and \"Tear me apart, you beast!\" and other equally idiotic things. I ran to the \n",
       "mirror in the breaks, but just imagine, Geralt, I looked at myself with growing anxiety. Less \n",
       "and less did I long to return to my former shape. You see, Geralt, I used to be a weakling and \n",
       "now I'd become a strapping fellow. I'd keep getting ill, I'd cough, my nose would run, but now \n",
       "I don't catch anything. And my teeth? You wouldn't believe how rotten my teeth had been! \n",

       "'Maybe that's good.' The monster opened his mouth wide. 'My showing-off used to amuse the \n",
       "girls and there aren't many whole chairs left in the house.' Nivellen yawned, his enormous \n",
       "tongue rolling up into a tube. \n",
       "\n",
       "'This talking has made me tired, Geralt. Briefly: there were two after Primula, Ilka and \n",
       "Venimira. Everything happened in the same way, to the point of boredom. First, a mixture of \n",
       "fear and reserve, then a thread of sympathy re-enforced by small but precious gifts, then \"Bite \n",
       "me, eat me up\", Daddy's return, a tender farewell and an increasingly discernible depletion of \n",
       "the treasury. I decided to take longer breaks to be alone. Of course, I'd long ago stopped \n",
       "believing that a virgin's kiss would transform the way I looked. And I'd come to terms with it. \n",
       "And, what's more, I'd come to the conclusion that things were fine as they were and that there \n",

       "different works on girls like an aphrodisiac. Don't laugh! I'm certain that as a human I'd have \n",
       "to give a mighty good chase to get at a girl like, for example, Venimira, who was an \n",
       "extremely beautiful maid. I don't suppose she'd have glanced twice at the fellow in the \n",
       "portrait. And thirdly: safety. Father had enemies, and a couple of them had survived. People \n",
       "whom the crew, under my pitiful leadership, had sent to their graves, had relatives. There's \n",
       "gold in the cellar. If it wasn't \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "'You seem quite sure,' Geralt remarked, playing with an empty chalice, 'that you haven't \n",

       "betrothed-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Leave off, Geralt.' Nivellen was indignant. 'What are you talking about? The fathers couldn't \n",
       "contain themselves for joy. I told you, I was incredibly generous. And the daughters? You \n",
       "didn't see them when they got here in their dresses of sackcloth, their little hands raw from \n",
       "washing, their shoulders stooped from carrying buckets. Even after two weeks with me \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Primula still had marks on her back and thighs from the strap her knightly father had beaten \n",
       "her with. They walked around like princesses here, carried nothing but a fan and didn't even \n",
       "know where the kitchen was. I dressed them up and covered them with trinkets. At the click \n",
       "of a finger, I'd conjure up hot water in the tin bath Father had plundered for my mother at \n",
       "Assengard. Can you imagine? A tin bath! There's hardly a regent, what am I saying, hardly a \n",
       "lord who's got a tin bath at home. This was a house from a fairy tale for them, Geralt. And as \n",
       "far as bed is concerned, well . . . Pox on it, virtue is rarer today than a rock dragon. I didn't \n",
       "force any of them, Geralt.' \n",

       "\n",
       "'Witcher,' answered the monster after a moment's hesitation, 'I think that, in principle, I ought \n",
       "to insult you, take you by the neck and throw you down the stairs. Do you know why? \n",
       "Because you treat me like a dimwit. I noticed how you've been cocking \n",
       "\n",
       "your ears and glancing at the door. You know perfectly well that I don't live alone. Am I \n",

       "'Quite right.' Nivellen also got up. 'For certain reasons I can't offer you a room in the manor \n",
       "for the night, and I don't encourage you to spend the night in these woods. Ever since the \n",

       "\n",
       "instead of answering mine. Obviously, you've got to be asked in the right way. Listen. For \n",

       "a vampire, rulers of a forest castle. You'd dominate the whole area in a flash. You, eternally \n",

       "cross his \n",
       "\n",
       "wrists in the Sign of Heliotrop. The spell cushioned some of his impact with the wall but even \n",

       "\n",
       "On the dolphin's back, in the stone circle of the dried-up fountain where a dainty girl in a \n",
       "white dress had sat just a moment ago, an enormous black bat flattened its glossy body, \n",
       "opening its long, narrow jaws wide, revealing rows of needle-like white teeth. The \n",
       "membranous wings spread and flapped silently, and the creature charged at the witcher like an \n",
       "arrow fired from a crossbow. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt, with the metallic taste of blood in his mouth, shouted a spell and threw his hand, \n",
       "fingers spread in the Sign of Quen, out in front of him. The bat, hissing, turned abruptly, then \n",
       "chuckled and veered up into the air before diving down vertically, straight at the nape of the \n",
       "witcher's neck. Geralt jumped aside, slashed, and missed. The bat, smoothly, gracefully drew \n",
       "in a wing, circled around him and attacked anew, opening its eyeless, toothed snout wide. \n",
       "Geralt waited, sword held with both hands, always pointed in the creature's direction. At the \n",
       "last moment, he jumped - not to the side but forward, dealing a swinging cut which made the \n",
       "air howl. \n",
       "\n",
       "He missed. It was so unexpected that he lost his rhythm and dodged a fraction of a second too \n",
       "late. He felt the beast's talons tear his cheek, and a damp velvety wing slapped against his \n",
       "neck. He curled up on the spot, transferred the weight of his body to his right leg and slashed \n",
       "backwards sharply, missing the amazingly agile creature again. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The bat beat its wings, soared up and glided towards the fountain. As the crooked claws \n",
       "scraped against the stone casing the monstrous, slobbering snout was already blurring, \n",
       "morphing, disappearing, although the pale little lips which were taking its place couldn't quite \n",
       "hide the murderous fangs. \n",
       "\n",
       "The bruxa howled piercingly, modulating her voice into a macabre tune, glared at the witcher \n",
       "with eyes full of hatred, and screamed again. \n",
       "\n",
       "The soundwave was so powerful it broke through the Sign. Black and red circles spun in \n",
       "Geralt's eyes; his temples and the \n",
       "\n",
       "crown of his head throbbed. Through the pain drilling in his ears, he began to hear voices \n",
       "wailing and moaning, the sound of flute and oboe, the rustle of a gale. The skin on his face \n",
       "grew numb and cold. He fell to one knee and shook his head. \n",
       "\n",
       "The black bat floated towards him silently, opening its toothy jaws. Geralt, still stunned by the \n",
       "scream, reacted instinctively. He jumped up and, in a flash, matching the tempo of his \n",
       "movements to the speed of the monster's flight, took three steps forward, dodged, turned a \n",
       "semi-circle and then, quick as a thought, delivered a two-handed blow. The blade met with no \n",
       "resistance . . . almost no resistance. He heard a scream, but this time it was a scream of pain, \n",
       "caused by the touch of silver. \n",
       "\n",
       "The wailing bruxa was morphing on the dolphin's back. On her white dress, slightly above her \n",
       "left breast, a red stain was visible beneath a slash no longer than a little finger. The witcher \n",
       "ground his teeth - the cut, which should have sundered the beast in two, had been nothing but \n",
       "a scratch. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Shout, vampire,' he growled, wiping the blood from his cheek. 'Scream your guts out. Lose \n",
       "your strength. And then I'll slash your pretty little head off!' \n",
       "\n",
       "You. You will be the first to grow weak, Sorcerer. I will kill you. \n",
       "\n",
       "The bruxa's lips didn't move, but the witcher heard the words clearly; they resounded in his \n",
       "mind, echoing and reverberating as if underwater. \n",
       "\n",
       "'We shall see,' he muttered through his teeth as he walked, bent over, in the direction of the \n",

       "'Vereena!' Nivellen, his head hanging low and both hands clinging to the doorframe, stumbled \n",

       "stained the cuff of his tunic. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Vereena!' he roared again. \n",
       "\n",
       "The bruxa jerked her head in his direction. Geralt, raising his sword to strike, jumped towards \n",
       "her, but the vampire's reaction was much faster. A sharp scream and another soundwave \n",
       "knocked \n",
       "\n",
       "the witcher from his feet. He tumbled onto his back and scraped against the gravel of the path. \n",
       "The bruxa arched and tensed to jump, her fangs flashing like daggers. Nivellen, spreading his \n",
       "paws like a bear, tried to grab her but she screamed straight into his face, throwing him back \n",
       "against the wooden scaffolding under the wall, which broke with a sharp crash and buried him \n",
       "beneath a stack of timber. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt was already on his feet, running, tracing a semi-circle around the courtyard, trying to \n",
       "draw the bruxa's attention away from Nivellen. The vampire, fluttering her white dress, \n",
       "scurried straight at him, light as a butterfly, barely touching the ground. She was no longer \n",
       "screaming, no longer trying to morph. The witcher knew she was tired, and that she was still \n",
       "lethal. Behind Geralt's back, Nivellen was clattering under the scaffolding, roaring. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt leapt to the left, executing a short moulinet with his sword to confuse the bruxa gliding \n",
       "towards him - white and black, wind-blown, terrible. He'd underestimated her. She \n",
       "screamed. He didn't make the Sign in time, flew backwards until he thumped against the wall. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The pain in his spine shot all the way to the tips of his fingers, paralysed his shoulders, cut \n",
       "him down at the legs. He fell to his knees. The bruxa, wailing melodiously, jumped towards \n",
       "him. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Vereena!' roared Nivellen. \n",
       "\n",
       "She turned - and Nivellen forced the sharp broken end of a three-metre-long pole between her \n",
       "breasts. She didn't shout. She only sighed. \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher shook, hearing this sigh. \n",
       "\n",
       "They stood there: Nivellen, on wide-spread legs, was wielding the pole in both hands, one end \n",
       "firmly secured under his arm. \n",
       "\n",
       "The bruxa, like a white butterfly on a pin, hung on the other end of the stake clutching it with \n",
       "both hands. The vampire exhaled excruciatingly and suddenly pressed herself hard against the \n",
       "stake. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt watched a red stain bloom on her back, on the white dress through which the broken tip \n",
       "emerged in a geyser of blood: hideous, almost obscene. Nivellen screamed, took one step \n",
       "back, \n",
       "\n",
       "then another, retreating from her, but he didn't let go of the pole and dragged the bruxa behind \n",
       "him. One more step and he leaned back against the mansion. The end of the pole scraped \n",
       "against the wall. \n",
       "\n",
       "Slowly, as if a caress, the bruxa moved her tiny hands along the stake, stretched her arms out \n",
       "to their full length, grasped the pole hard and pulled on it again. Over a metre of bloodied \n",
       "wood already protruded from her back. Her eyes were wide open, her head flung back. Her \n",
       "sighs became more frequent and rhythmic, turning into a ruckling wheeze. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt stood but, fascinated by the scene, still couldn't make himself act. He heard words \n",
       "resounding dully within his skull, as if echoing around a cold, damp dungeon. \n",
       "\n",
       "Mine. Or nobody's. I love you. Love you. \n",
       "\n",
       "Another terrible, vibrating sigh, choking in blood. The bruxa moved further along the pole \n",
       "and stretched out her arms. Nivellen roared desperately and, without letting go of the stake, \n",
       "tried to push the vampire as far from himself as possible - but in vain. She pulled herself \n",
       "closer and grabbed him by the head. He wailed horrifically and tossed his hairy head. The \n",
       "bruxa moved along the pole again and tilted her head towards Nivellen's throat. The fangs \n",
       "flashed a blinding white. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt jumped. Every move he made, every step, was part of his nature: hard-learnt, automatic \n",
       "and lethally sure. Three quick steps, and the third, like a hundred such steps before, finished \n",
       "on the left leg with a strong, firm stamp. A twist of his torso and a sharp, forceful cut. He saw \n",
       "her eyes. Nothing could change now. He heard the voice. Nothing. He yelled, to drown the \n",
       "word which she was repeating. Nothing could change. He cut. \n",
       "\n",
       "He struck decisively, like hundreds of times before, with the centre of the blade, and \n",
       "immediately, following the rhythm of the movement, took a fourth step and half a turn. The \n",
       "blade, freed by the half-turn, floated after him, shining, drawing a fan of red droplets in its \n",
       "wake. The streaming raven-black hair floated in the air, floated, floated, floated . . . \n",
       "\n",
       "The head fell onto the gravel. \n",

       "'Prince.' Tailles, the younger of the knights, corrected her emphatically, fixing his hostile pale \n",
       "blue eyes on the priestess. 'Prince Hereward.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Let's not waste time with details and titles.' Nenneke smiled mockingly. 'In my day, only \n",
       "those with royal blood were addressed as princes, but now, it seems, titles don't mean so \n",
       "much. Let's get back to our introductions, and why the Knights of the White Rose are visiting \n",
       "my humble temple. You know, Geralt, that the Chapter is requesting investitures for the Order \n",
       "from Hereward, which is why so many Knights of the Rose have entered his service. And a \n",
       "number of locals, like Tailles here, have taken vows and assumed the red cloak which \n",
       "becomes him so well.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'My honour.' The witcher bowed once more, just as cursorily as before. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I doubt it,' the priestess remarked coldly. 'They haven't come here to honour you. Quite the \n",
       "opposite. They've arrived demanding that you leave as soon as possible. In short, they're here \n",
       "to chase you out. You consider that an honour? I don't. I consider it an insult.' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'The noble knights have troubled themselves for no reason,' shrugged Geralt. 'I don't intend to \n",
       "settle here. I'm leaving of my own accord without any additional incentives, and soon at that.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Immeditaely,' growled Tailles. 'With not a moment's delay. The prince orders-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'In this temple, I give the orders,' interrupted Nenneke in a cold, authoritative voice. 'I usually \n",
       "try to ensure my orders don't conflict too much with Hereward's politics, as far as those \n",
       "politics are logical and understandable. In this case they are irrational, so I won't treat them \n",
       "any more seriously than they deserve. Geralt, witcher of Rivia, is my guest. His stay is a \n",
       "pleasure to me. So he will stay in my temple for as long as he wishes.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You have the audacity to contradict the prince, woman?' Tailles shouted, then threw his cloak \n",
       "back over his shoulder to reveal his grooved, brass-edged breast-plate in all its splendour. \n",
       "'You dare to question our ruler's authority?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Quiet,' Nenneke snapped and narrowed her eyes. 'Lower your voice. Have a care who you \n",
       "speak to like that.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I know who I'm talking to!' The knight advanced a step. Falwick, the older knight, grabbed \n",
       "him firmly by the elbow and squeezed until the armour-plated gauntlet grated. Tailles yanked \n",
       "furiously. 'And my words express the prince's will, the lord of this estate! We have got \n",
       "soldiers in the yard, woman-' \n",
       "\n",
       "Nenneke reached into the purse at her belt and took out a small porcelain jar. 'I really don't \n",
       "know,' she said calmly, 'what will happen if I smash this container at your feet, Tailles. Maybe \n",
       "your lungs will burst. Maybe you'll grow fur. Or maybe both, who knows? Only merciful \n",
       "Melitele.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Don't dare threaten me with your spells, priestess! Our soldiers-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'If any one of your soldiers touches one of Melitele's priestesses, they will hang, before dusk, \n",
       "from the acacias along the road to town. And they know that very well. As do you, Tailles, so \n",
       "stop acting like a fool. I delivered you, you shitty brat, and I pity your \n",
       "\n",
       "mother, but don't tempt fate. And don't force me to teach you manners!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'All right, all right,' the witcher butted in, growing bored. 'It looks as though I'm becoming the \n",
       "cause of a serious conflict and I don't see why I should. Sir Falwick, you look more level-\n",
       "headed than your companion who, I see, is beside himself\" with youthful enthusiasm. Listen, \n",
       "Falwick, I assure you that I will leave in a few days. I also assure you that I have no intention \n",
       "to work here, to undertake any commissions or orders. I'm not here as a witcher, but on \n",
       "personal business.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Count Falwick met his eyes and Geralt realised his mistake. There was pure, unwavering \n",
       "hatred in the White Rose knight's eyes. The witcher was sure that it was not Duke Hereward \n",
       "who was chasing him out, but Falwick and his like. \n",
       "\n",
       "The knight turned to Nenneke, bowed with respect and began to speak. He spoke calmly and \n",
       "politely. He spoke logically. But Geralt knew Falwick was lying through his teeth. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Venerable Nenneke, I ask your forgiveness, but Prince Hereward will not tolerate the \n",
       "presence of this witcher on his lands. It is of no importance if he is hunting monsters or claims \n",
       "to be here on personal business - the prince knows that witchers do not undertake personal \n",
       "business. But they do attract trouble like a magnet filings. The wizards are rebelling and \n",
       "writing petitions, the druids are threatening-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I don't see why Geralt should bear the consequences of the unruliness of local wizards and \n",
       "druids,' interrupted the priestess. 'Since when has Hereward been interested in either's \n",
       "opinion?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Enough of this discussion.' Falwick stiffened. 'Have I not made myself sufficiently clear, \n",
       "venerable Nenneke? I will make it so clear as can't be clearer: neither the prince nor the \n",
       "Chapter of the Order will tolerate the presence of this witcher, Geralt, the Butcher of \n",
       "Blaviken, in Ellander for one more day.' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'This isn't Ellander!' The priestess sprang from her chair. 'This is the temple of Melitele! And \n",
       "I, Nenneke, the high priestess of Melitele, will not tolerate your presence on temple grounds a \n",
       "minute longer, sirs!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Sir Falwick,' the witcher said quietly, 'listen to the voice of reason. I don't want any trouble, \n",
       "nor do I believe that you particularly care for it. I'll leave this neighbourhood within three \n",
       "days. No, Nenneke, don't say anything, please. It's time for me to be on my way. Three days. I \n",
       "don't ask for more.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And you're right not to ask.' The priestess spoke before Falwick could react. 'Did you hear, \n",
       "boys? The witcher will remain here for three days because that's his fancy. And I, priestess of \n",
       "Great Melitele, will for those three days be his host, for that is my fancy. Tell that to \n",
       "Hereward. No, not Hereward. Tell that to his wife, the noble Ermellia, adding that if she \n",
       "wants to continue receiving an uninterrupted supply of aphrodisiacs from my pharmacy, she'd \n",
       "better calm her duke down. Let her curb his humours and whims, which look ever more like \n",
       "symptoms of idiocy.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Enough!' Tailles shouted so shrilly his voice broke into a falsetto. 'I don't intend to stand by \n",
       "and listen as some charlatan insults my lord and his wife! I will not let such an insult pass \n",
       "unnoticed! It is the Order of the White Rose which will rule here, now; it's the end of your \n",
       "nests of darkness and superstitions. And I, a Knight of the White Rose-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Shut up, you brat,' interrupted Geralt, smiling nastily. 'Halt your uncontrolled little tongue. \n",
       "You speak to a lady who deserves respect, especially from a Knight of the White Rose. \n",
       "Admittedly, to become one it's enough, lately, to pay a thousand Novigrad crowns into the \n",
       "Chapter's treasury, so the Order's full of sons of money-lenders and tailors - but surely some \n",
       "manners have survived? But maybe I'm mistaken?' \n",
       "\n",
       "Tailles grew pale and reached to his side. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Sir Falwick,' said Geralt, not ceasing to smile. 'If he draws his sword, I'll take it from him and \n",
       "beat the snotty-nosed little brat's arse with the flat of his blade. And then I'll batter the door \n",
       "down with him.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Tailles, his hands shaking, pulled an iron gauntlet from his belt and, with a crash, threw it to \n",
       "the ground at the witcher's feet. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I'll wash away the insult to the Order with your blood, mutant!' he yelled. 'On beaten ground! \n",

       "\n",
       "'You've dropped something, son,' Nenneke said calmly. 'So pick it up, we don't leave rubbish \n",
       "here. This is a temple. Falwick, take that fool from here or this will end in grief. You know \n",
       "what you're to tell Hereward. And I'll write a personal letter to him; you don't look like \n",
       "trustworthy messangers to me. Get out of here. You can find your way out, I hope?' \n",
       "\n",
       "Falwick, restraining the enraged Tallies with an iron grip, bowed, his armour clattering. Then \n",
       "he looked the witcher in the eyes. The witcher didn't smile. Falwick threw his crimson cloak \n",
       "over his shoulders. \n",

       "The cart finally turned down a side-street leading to a granary and harbour from which a sea-\n",

       "to the muffled cry of the woman selling vegetables who was staring at the bony, taloned paw \n",
       "sticking out beneath the horse-blanket, bobbing up and down in time with the donkey's trot. \n",

       "There were, as usual, many carts in front of the alderman's house. Geralt jumped from the \n",

       "\n",
       "from town. It is the duty of every resident wizard to look after the safety of the \n",
       "neighbourhood. Master Irion does not have to honour me with conversation, does not have to \n",
       "receive me, if that is his will. But let him examine the kikimora and draw his own \n",
       "conclusions. Carrypebble, unstrap the kikimora and throw it down by the door.' \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "'Let's go, Caldemeyn. Carrypebble, take that finger out of your nose and do as I said.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'One moment,' the knocker said in an entirely different tone. 'Geralt, is that really you?' \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher swore quietly. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I'm losing patience. Yes, it's really me. So what?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Come up to the door,' said the knocker, puffing out a small cloud of steam. 'Alone. I'll let you \n",
       "in.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What about the kikimora?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'To hell with it. I want to talk to you, Geralt. Just you. Forgive me, Alderman.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What's it to me, Master Irion?' Caldemeyn waved the matter aside. 'Take care, Geralt. We'll \n",
       "see each other later. Carrypebble! Into the cesspool with the monster!' \n",
       "\n",
       "As you command.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher approached the inlaid door, which opened a little bit - just enough for him to \n",
       "squeeze through - and then slammed shut, leaving him in complete darkness. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Hey!' he shouted, not hiding his anger. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Just a moment,' answered a strangely familiar voice. \n",
       "\n",
       "The feeling was so unexpected that the witcher staggered and stretched out his hand, looking \n",
       "for support. He didn't find any. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The orchard was blossoming with white and pink, and smelled of rain. The sky was split by \n",
       "the many-coloured arc of a rainbow, which bound the crowns of the trees to the distant, blue \n",
       "chain of mountains. The house nestled in the orchard, tiny and modest, was drowning in \n",
       "hollyhocks. Geralt looked down and discovered that he was up to his knees in thyme. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Well, come on, Geralt,' said the voice. 'I'm in front of the house.' \n",
       "\n",
       "He entered the orchard, walking through the trees. He noticed a movement to his left and \n",
       "looked round. A fair-haired girl, entirely naked, was walking along a row of shrubs carrying a \n",
       "basket full of apples. The witcher solemnly promised himself that nothing would surprise him \n",
       "anymore. \n",
       "\n",
       "'At last. Greetings, witcher.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Stregobor!' Geralt was surprised. \n",
       "\n",
       "During his life, the witcher had met thieves who looked like town councillors, councillors \n",
       "who looked like beggars, harlots who looked like princesses, princesses who looked like \n",
       "calving cows and kings who looked like thieves. But Stregobor always looked as, according \n",
       "to every rule and notion, a wizard should look. He was tall, thin and stooping, with enormous \n",
       "bushy grey eyebrows and a long, crooked nose. To top it off, he wore a black, trailing robe \n",
       "with improbably wide sleeves, and wielded a long staff capped with a crystal knob. None of \n",
       "the wizards Geralt knew looked like Stregobor. Most surprising of all was that Stregobor was, \n",
       "indeed, a wizard. \n",
       "\n",
       "They sat in wicker chairs at a white marble-topped table on a porch surrounded by \n",
       "hollyhocks. The naked blonde with the apple basket approached, smiled, turned and, swaying \n",
       "her hips, returned to the orchard. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Is that an illusion, too?' asked Geralt, watching the sway. \n",
       "\n",
       "'It is. Like everything here. But it is, my friend, a first-class illusion. The flowers smell, you \n",
       "can eat the apples, the bee can sting you, and she,' the wizard indicated the blonde, 'you can-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Maybe later.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Quite right. What are you doing here, Geralt? Are you still toiling away, killing the last \n",
       "representatives of dying species for money? How much did you get for the kikimora? \n",
       "Nothing, I guess, or you wouldn't have come here. And to think that there are people who \n",
       "don't believe in destiny. Unless you knew about me. Did you?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'No, I didn't. It's the last place I could have expected you. If \n",
       "\n",
       "my memory serves me correctly you used to live in a similar tower in Kovir.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A great deal has changed since then.' 'Such as your name. Apparently, you're Master Irion \n",
       "now.' 'That's the name of the man who created this tower. He died about two hundred years \n",
       "ago, and I thought it right to honour him in some way since I occupied his abode. I'm living \n",
       "here. Most of the inhabitants live off the sea and, as you know, my speciality, apart from \n",
       "illusions, is weather. Sometimes I'll calm a storm, sometimes conjure one up, sometimes drive \n",
       "schools of whiting and cod closer to the shores with the westerly wind. I can survive. That is,' \n",
       "he added, miserably, 'I could.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'How come \"I could\"? Why the change of name?' 'Destiny has many faces. Mine is beautiful \n",
       "on the outside and hideous on the inside. She has stretched her bloody talons towards me-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You've not changed a bit, Stregobor.' Geralt grimaced. 'You're talking nonsense while making \n",
       "wise and meaningful faces. Can't you speak normally?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I can,' sighed the wizard. 'I can if that makes you happy. I made it all the way here, hiding \n",
       "and running from a monstrous being that wants to murder me. My escape proved in vain - it \n",
       "found me. In all probability, it's going to try to kill me tomorrow, or at the latest, the day \n",
       "after.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Aha,' said the witcher, dispassionately. 'Now I understand.' 'My facing death doesn't impress \n",
       "you much, does it?' 'Stregobor,' said Geralt, 'that's the way of the world. One sees all sorts of \n",
       "things when one travels. Two peasants kill each other over a field which, the following day, \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "will be trampled flat by two counts and their retinues trying to kill each other off. Men hang \n",
       "from trees at the roadside, brigands slash merchants' throats. At every step in town you trip \n",
       "over corpses in the gutters. In palaces they stab each other with daggers, and somebody falls \n",
       "under the table at a banquet every minute, blue from poisoning. I'm used to it. So why should \n",
       "a death threat impress me, and one directed at you at that?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'One directed at me at that,' Stregobor repeated with a sneer. 'And I considered you a friend. \n",
       "Counted on your help.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Our last meeting,' said Geralt, 'was in the court of King Idi of Kovir. I'd come to be paid for \n",
       "killing the amphisboena which had been terrorising the neighbourhood. You and your \n",
       "compatriot Zavist vied with each other to call me a charlatan, a thoughtless murdering \n",
       "machine and a scavenger. Consequently not only didn'l Idi pay me a penny, he gave me \n",
       "twelve hours to leave Kovir and, since his hourglass was broken, I barely made it. And now \n",
       "you say you're counting on my help. You say a monster's after you. What are you afraid of, \n",
       "Stregobor? If it catches up with you, tell it you like monsters, that you protect them and make \n",
       "sure no witcher scavenger ever troubles their peace. Indeed, if the monster disembowels and \n",
       "devours you, it'll prove terribly ungrateful.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The wizard turned his head away silently. Geralt laughed. 'Don't get all puffed up like a frog, \n",
       "magician. Tell me what's threatening you. We'll see what can be done.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Have you heard of the Curse of the Black Sun?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'But of course. Except that it was called the Mania of Mad Eltibald after the wizard who \n",
       "started the lark and caused dozens of girls from good, even noble, families to be murdered or \n",
       "imprisoned in towers. They were supposed to have been possessed by demons, cursed, \n",
       "contaminated by the Black Sun, because that's what, in your pompous jargon, you called the \n",
       "most ordinary eclipse in the world.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Eltibald wasn't mad at all. He deciphered the writing on Dauk menhirs, on tombstones in the \n",
       "Wozgor necropolises, and examined the legends and traditions of weretots. All of them spoke \n",
       "of the eclipse in no uncertain terms. The Black Sun was to announce the imminent return of \n",
       "Lilit, still honoured in the East under the name of Niya, and the extermination of the human \n",
       "race. Lilit 's path was to be prepared by \"sixty women wearing gold crown.s, who would fill \n",
       "the river valleys with blood\".' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Nonsense,' said the witcher. And what's more, it doesn't rhyme. All decent predictions \n",
       "rhyme. Everyone knows what Elti-bald and the Council of Wizards had in mind at the time. \n",
       "You \n",
       "\n",
       "took advantage of a madman's ravings to strengthen your own authority. To break up \n",
       "alliances, ruin marriage allegiances, stir up dynasties. In a word: to tangle the strings of \n",
       "crowned puppets even more. And here you are lecturing me about predictions, which any old \n",
       "storyteller at the marketplace would be ashamed of.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You can have your reservations about Eltibald's theories, about how the predictions were \n",
       "interpreted. But you can't challenge the fact that there have been horrendous mutations among \n",
       "girls born just after the eclipse.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And why not? I've heard quite the opposite.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I was present when they did an autopsy on one of them,' said the wizard. 'Geralt, what we \n",
       "found inside the skull and marrow could not be described. Some sort of red sponge. The \n",
       "internal organs were all mixed up, some were missing completely. Everything was covered in \n",
       "moving cilia, bluish-pink shreds. The heart was six-chambered, with two chambers practically \n",
       "atrophied. What do you say to that?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I've seen people with eagles' talons instead of hands, people with a wolf's fangs. People with \n",
       "additional joints, additional organs and additional senses. All of which were the effects of \n",
       "your messing about with magic' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'You've seen all sorts of mutations, you say.' The magician raised his head. 'And how many of \n",
       "them have you slaughtered for money, in keeping with your witcher's calling? Well? Because \n",
       "one can have a wolf's fangs and go no further than baring them at the trollops in taverns, or \n",
       "one can have a wolf's nature, too, and attack children. And that's just how it was with the girls \n",
       "who were born after the eclipse. Their outright insane tendency to cruelty, aggression, sudden \n",
       "bursts of anger and an unbridled temperament, were noted.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You can say that about any woman,' sneered Geralt. 'What are you drivelling on about? \n",
       "You're asking me how many mutants I've killed. Why aren't you interested in how many I've \n",
       "extricated from spells, freed from curses? I, a witcher despised by you. And what have you \n",
       "done, you mighty magicians?' \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "'No. Don't look at me like that, you know very, well that there were more corpses, too. It was \n",
       "initially decided to eliminate all of them. We got rid of a few . . . autopsies were done on all of \n",
       "them. One of them was even vivisectioned.' \n",
       "\n",
       "And you sons-of-bitches have the nerve to criticise witchers? Oh, Stregobor, the day will \n",
       "come when people will learn, and get the better of you.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I don't think a day like that will come soon,' said the wizard caustically. 'Don't forget that we \n",

       "\n",
       "'So say you magicians, turning your noses up, so high and mighty with your auras of \n",

       "these so-called mutants you haven't once made a mistake?' \n",
       "\n",
       "All right,' said Stregobor after a long silence. 'I'll be honest, although for my own sake I \n",
       "shouldn't. We did make a mistake -more than one. Picking them out was extremely difficult. \n",
       "And that's why we stopped , . . getting rid of them, and started isolating them instead.' \n",

       "\n",
       "'Our towers. But that was another mistake. We underestimated them. Many escaped. Then \n",
       "some mad fashion to free imprisoned beauties took hold of princes, especially the younger \n",
       "ones, who didn't have much to do and still less to lose. Most of them, fortunately, twisted their \n",
       "necks-' \n",
       "\n",
       "As far as I know, those imprisoned in the towers died quickly. It's been said you must have \n",
       "helped them somewhat.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That's a lie. But it is true that they quickly fell into apathy, refused to eat . . . What is \n",
       "interesting is that shortly before they died they showed signs of the gift of clairvoyance. \n",
       "Further proof of mutation.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Your proofs are becoming ever less convincing. Do you have any more?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I do. Silvena, the lady of Narok, whom we never managed to get close to because she gained \n",
       "power so quickly. Terrible things are happening in Narok now. Fialka, Evermir's daughter, \n",
       "escaped her tower using a home-made rope and is now terrorising North Velhad. Bernika of \n",
       "Talgar was freed by an idiot prince. Now he's sitting in a dungeon, blinded, and the most \n",
       "common feature of the Talgar landscape is a set of gallows. There are other examples, too.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Of course there are,' said the witcher. 'In Yamurlak, for instance, old man Abrad reigns. He's \n",
       "got scrofula, not a single tooth in his head, was probably born some hundred years before this \n",
       "eclipse, and can't fall asleep unless someone's being tortured to death in his presence. He's \n",
       "wiped out all his relatives and emptied half of the country in crazy - how did you put it? - \n",
       "attacks of anger. There are also traces of a rampant temperament. Apparently he was \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "nicknamed Abrad Jack-up-the-Skirt in his youth. Oh, Stregobor, it would be great if the \n",

       "'Listen, Geralt-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'No. You won't win me over with your reasons nor convince me that Eltibad wasn't a \n",
       "murdering madman, so let's get back to the monster threatening you. You'd better understand \n",
       "that, after the introduction you've given me, I don't like the story. But I'll hear you out.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Without interrupting with spiteful comments?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That I can't promise.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Oh well,' Stregobor slipped his hands into the sleeves of his robe, 'then it'll only take longer. \n",
       "Well, the story begins in Creyden, a small principality in the north. The wife of Fredefalk, the \n",
       "Prince of Creyden, was Aridea, a wise, educated woman. She had many exceptional adepts of \n",
       "the magical arts in her family and - through inheritance, no doubt - she came into possession \n",
       "of a rare and powerful artefact. One of Nehalenia's Mirrors. They're chiefly used by prophets \n",
       "and oracles because they predict the future \n",
       "\n",
       "accurately, albeit intricately. Aridea quite often turned to the Mirror-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'With the usual question, I take it,' interrupted Geralt. '\"Who is the fairest of them all?\" I \n",
       "know; all Nehalenia's Mirrors are either polite or broken.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You're wrong. Aridea was more interested in her country's fate. And the Mirror answered her \n",
       "questions by predicting a horrible death for her and for a great number of others by the hand, \n",
       "or fault, of Fredefalk's daughter from his first marriage. Aridea ensured this news reached the \n",
       "Council, and the Council sent me to Creyden. I don't have to add that Fredefalk's first-born \n",
       "daughter was born shortly after the eclipse. I was quite discreet for a little while. She managed \n",
       "to torture a canary and two puppies during that time, and also gouged out a servant's eye with \n",
       "the handle of a comb. I carried out a few tests using curses, and most of them confirmed that \n",
       "the little one was a mutant. I went to Aridea with the news because Fredefalk's daughter \n",
       "meant the world to him. Aridea, as I said, wasn't stupid-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Of course,' Geralt interrupted again, 'and no doubt she wasn't head-over-heels in love with her \n",
       "stepdaughter. She preferred her own children to inherit the throne. I can guess what followed. \n",
       "How come nobody throttled her? And you, too, while they were at it.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Stregobor sighed, raised his eyes to heaven, where the rainbow was still shimmering \n",
       "colourfully and picturesquely. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I wanted to isolate her, but Aridea decided otherwise. She sent the little one out into the forest \n",
       "with a hired thug, a trapper. We found him later in the undergrowth . . . without any trousers, \n",
       "so it wasn't hard to recreate the turn of events. She had dug a brooch-pin into his brain, \n",
       "through his ear, no doubt while his attention was on entirely different matters.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'If you think I feel sorry for him,' muttered Geralt, 'then you're wrong.' \n",
       "\n",
       "We organised a manhunt,' continued Stregobor, 'but all traces of the little one had \n",
       "disappeared. I had to leave Creyden in a hurry because Fredefalk was beginning to suspect \n",
       "something, \n",
       "\n",
       "Then, four years later I received news from Aridea. She'd tracked down the little one, who \n",
       "was living in Mahakam with seven gnomes whom she'd managed to convince it was more \n",
       "profitable to rob merchants on the roads than to pollute their lungs with dust from the mines. \n",
       "She was known as Shrike because she liked to impale the people she caught on a sharp pole \n",
       "while they were still alive. Several times Aridea hired assassins, but none of them returned. \n",
       "Well, then it became hard to find anyone to try - Shrike had already become quite famous. \n",
       "She'd learnt to use a sword so well there was hardly a man who could defy her. I was \n",
       "summoned, and arrived in Creyden secretly, only to learn that someone had poisoned Aridea. \n",
       "It was generally believed that it was the work of Fredefalk, who had found himself a younger, \n",
       "more robust mistress - but I think it was Renfri.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Renfri?' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'That's what she was called. I said she'd poisoned Aridea. Shortly afterwards Prince Fredefalk \n",
       "died in a strange hunting accident, and Aridea's eldest son disappeared without a word. That \n",
       "must have been the little one's doing, too. I say \"little\" but she was seventeen by then. And she \n",
       "was pretty well-developed. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Meanwhile,' the wizard picked up after a moment's break, 'she and her gnomes had become \n",
       "the terror of the whole of Mahakam. Until, one day, they argued about something, I don't \n",
       "know what -sharing out the loot, or whose turn it was to spend the night with her - anyway, \n",
       "they slaughtered each other with knives. Only Shrike survived. Only her. And I was in the \n",
       "neighbourhood at the time. We met face to face: she recognised me in a flash and knew the \n",
       "part I'd played in Creyden. I tell you, Geralt, I had barely managed to utter a curse - and my \n",
       "hands were shaking like anything - when that wildcat flew at me with a sword. I turned her \n",
       "into a neat slab of mountain crystal, six ells by nine. When she fell into a lethargy I threw the \n",
       "slab into the gnomes' mine and brought the tunnels down on it.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Shabby work,' commented Geralt. 'That spell could have been reversed. Couldn't you have \n",

       "decorated belt. Her skirt was uneven, asymmetrical - reaching down to her calf on the left, \n",

       "hair around her finger. 'But you're already married, as we well know.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Aaahh.' The baron was miffed. 'You know yourself, ma'am, how weak and delicate my wife \n",

       "chased you for almost a mile with a pitchfork but couldn't catch you. You have to feed her \n",

       "'I'll tell you when you've outlined my task, your Majesty.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Geralt,' said Calanthe, her fingers tapping an emerald necklace, the smallest stone of which \n",
       "was the size of a bumble-bee, 'what sort of task do you expect, as a witcher? What? Digging a \n",
       "well? Repairing a hole in the roof? Weaving a tapestry of all the positions King Vridank and \n",
       "the beautiful Cerro tried on their wedding night? Surely you know what your profession's \n",

       "different profession.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Oh?' Calanthe, casually leaning towards the lute-strumming Drogodar, gave the impression of \n",
       "being pensive and absent. 'Who, Geralt, makes up this ignorant horde with whom you equate \n",
       "me? And for what profession do those fools mistake your trade?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Your Majesty,' said Geralt calmly, 'while I was riding to Cintra, I met villagers, merchants, \n",
       "peddlers, dwarves, tinkers and woodcutters. They told me about a black annis who has its \n",
       "hideout somewhere in these woods, a little house on a chicken-claw tripod. They mentioned a \n",
       "chimera nestling in the mountains. Aeschnes and centipedeanomorphs. Apparently a \n",
       "manticore could also be found if you look hard enough. So many tasks a witcher \n",
       "\n",
       "could perform without having to dress up in someone else's feathers and coat of arms.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You didn't answer my question.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Your Majesty, I don't doubt that a marriage alliance with Skellige is necessary for Cintra. It's \n",
       "possible, too, that the schemers who want to prevent it deserve a lesson - using means which \n",
       "don't involve you. It's convenient if this lesson were to be given by an unknown lord from \n",
       "Fourhorn, who would then disappear from the scene. And now I'll answer your question. You \n",
       "mistake my trade for that of a hired killer. Those others, of whom there are so many, are \n",
       "rulers. It's not the first time I've been called to a court where the problems demand the quick \n",
       "solutions of a sword. But I've never killed people for money, regardless of whether it's for a \n",
       "good or bad cause. And I never will.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The atmosphere at the table was growing more and more lively as the beer diminished. The \n",
       "red-haired Crach an Craite found appreciative listeners to his tale of the battle at Thwyth. \n",
       "Having sketched a map on the table with the help of meat bones dipped in sauce, he marked \n",
       "out the strategic plan, shouting loudly. Coodcoodak, proving how apt his nickname was, \n",
       "suddenly cackled like a very real sitting hen, creating general mirth among the guests, and \n",
       "consternation among the servants who were convinced that a bird, mocking their vigilance, \n",
       "had somehow managed to make its way from the courtyard into the hall. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'Thus fate has punished me with too shrewd a witcher,' Calanthe smiled, but her eyes were \n",
       "narrowed and angry. 'A witcher who, without a shadow of respect or, at the very least, of \n",
       "common courtesy, exposes my intrigues and infamous plans. But hasn't fascination with my \n",
       "beauty and charming personality clouded your judgement? Don't ever do that again, Geralt. \n",
       "Don't speak to those in power like that. Few of them would forget your words, and you know \n",
       "kings - they have all sorts of things at their disposal: daggers, poisons, dungeons, red-hot \n",
       "pokers. There are hundreds, thousands, of ways kings can avenge their wounded pride. And \n",
       "you wouldn't believe how easy it is, Geralt, to wound some rulers' pride. Rarely will any of \n",
       "them take words such as \"No\", \"I won't\", \n",
       "\n",
       "and \"Never\" calmly. But that's nothing. Interrupt one of them or make inappropriate \n",
       "comments, and you'll condemn yourself to the wheel.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The queen clasped her narrow white hands together and lightly rested her chin on them. \n",
       "Geralt didn't interrupt, nor did he comment. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Kings,' continued Calanthe, 'divide people into two categories -those they order around, and \n",
       "those they buy - because they adhere to the old and banal truth that everyone can be bought. \n",
       "Everyone. It's only a question of price. Don't you agree? Ah, I don't need to ask. You're a \n",
       "witcher, after all, you do your job and take the money. As far as you're concerned the idea of \n",
       "being bought has lost its scornful undertone. The question of your price, too, is clear, related \n",
       "as it is to the difficulty of the task and how well you execute it. And your fame, Geralt. Old \n",
       "men at fairs and markets sing of the exploits of the white-haired witcher from Rivia. If even \n",
       "half of it is true then I wager your services are not cheap. So it would be a waste of money to \n",
       "engage you in such simple, trite matters as palace intrigue or murder. Those can be dealt with \n",
       "by other, cheaper hands.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'BRAAAK! Ghaaa-braaak!' roared Coodcoodak suddenly, to loud applause. Geralt didn't \n",
       "know which animal he was imitating, but he didn't want to meet anything like it. He turned \n",
       "his head and caught the queen's venomously green glance. Drogodar, his lowered head and \n",
       "face concealed by his curtain of grey hair, quietly strummed his lute. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Ah, Geralt,' said Calanthe, with a gesture forbidding a servant from refilling her goblet. 'I \n",
       "speak and you remain silent. We're at a feast. We all want to enjoy ourselves. Amuse me. I'm \n",
       "starting to miss your pertinent remarks and perceptive comments. I'd also be pleased to hear a \n",
       "compliment or two, homage or assurance of your obedience. In whichever order you choose.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Oh well, your Majesty,' said the witcher, 'I'm not a very interesting dinner companion. I'm \n",
       "amazed to be singled out for the honour of occupying this place. Indeed, someone far more \n",
       "appropriate should have been seated here. Anyone you wished. It \n",
       "\n",
       "would have sufficed for you to give them the order, or to buy them. It's only a question of \n",
       "price.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Go on, go on,' Calanthe tilted her head back and closed her eyes, the semblance of a pleasant \n",
       "smile on her lips. \n",
       "\n",
       "'So I'm honoured and proud to be sitting by Queen Calanthe of Cintra, whose beauty is \n",
       "surpassed only by her wisdom. I also regard it as a great honour that the queen has heard of \n",
       "me and that, on the basis of what she has heard, does not wish to use me for trivial matters. \n",
       "Last winter Prince Hrobarik, not being so gracious, tried to hire me to find a beauty who, sick \n",
       "of his vulgar advances, had fled the ball, losing a slipper. It was difficult to convince him that \n",
       "he needed a huntsman, and not a witcher.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The queen was listening with an enigmatic smile. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Other rulers, too, unequal to you in wisdom, didn't refrain from proposing trivial tasks. It was \n",
       "usually a question of the murder of a stepson, stepfather, stepmother, uncle, aunt - it's hard to \n",
       "mention them all. They were all of the opinion that it was simply a question of price.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The queen's smile could have meant anything. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'And so I repeat,' Geralt bowed his head a little, 'that I can't contain my pride to be sitting next \n",
       "to you, ma'am. And pride means a very great deal to us witchers. You wouldn't believe how \n",
       "much. A lord once offended a witcher's pride by proposing a job that wasn't in keeping with \n",
       "either honour or the witcher's code. What's more, he didn't accept a polite refusal and wished \n",
       "to prevent the witcher from leaving his castle. Afterwards everyone agreed this wasn't one of \n",
       "his best ideas.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Geralt,' said Calanthe, after a moment's silence, 'you were wrong. You're a very interesting \n",
       "dinner companion.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Coodcoodak, shaking beer froth from his whiskers and the front of his jacket, craned his neck \n",
       "and gave the penetrating howl of a she-wolf in heat. The dogs in the courtyard, and the entire \n",
       "neighbourhood, echoed the howl. \n",
       "\n",
       "One of the brothers from Strept dipped his finger in his beer and touched up the thick line \n",
       "around the formation drawn by Crach an Craite. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Error and incompetence!' he shouted. 'They shouldn't have done that! Here, towards the wing, \n",
       "that's where they should have directed the cavalry, struck the flanks!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Ha!' roared Crach an Craite, whacking the table with a bone and splattering his neighbours' \n",
       "faces and tunics with sauce. 'And so weaken the centre? A key position? Ludicrous!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Only someone who's blind or sick in the head would miss the opportunity to manoeuvre in a \n",
       "situation like that!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That's it! Quite right!' shouted Windhalm of Attre. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Who's asking you, you little snot?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Snot yourself!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Shut your gob or I'll wallop you-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Sit on your arse and keep quiet, Crach,' called Eist Tuirseach, interrupting his conversation \n",
       "with Vissegerd. 'Enough of these arguments. Drogodar, sir! Don't waste your talent! Indeed, \n",
       "your beautiful though quiet tunes should be listened to with greater concentration and gravity. \n",
       "Draig Bon-Dhu, stop scoffing and guzzling! You're not going to impress anyone here like \n",
       "that. Pump up your bagpipes and delight our ears with decent martial music. With your \n",
       "permission, noble Calanthe!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Oh mother of mine,' whispered the queen to Geralt, raising her eyes to the vault for a moment \n",
       "in silent resignation. But she nodded her permission, smiling openly and kindly. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Draig Bon-Dhu,' said Eist, 'play us the song of the battle of Cottbus. It won't leave us in \n",
       "any doubt as to the tactical manoeuvres of commanders - or as to who acquired immortal \n",
       "fame there! To the health of the heroic Calanthe of Cintra!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'The health! And glory!' The guests roared, emptying their goblets and clay cups. \n",
       "\n",
       "Draig Bon-Dhu's bagpipes gave out an ominous drone and burst into a terrible, drawn-out, \n",
       "modulated wail. The guests took up the song, beating out a rhythm on the table with whatever \n",
       "came to hand. Coodcoodak was staring avidly at the goat-leather sack, captivated by the idea \n",
       "of adopting its dreadful tones in his own repertoire. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Cottbus,' said Calante, looking at Geralt, 'my first battle. \n",
       "\n",
       "Although I fear rousing the indignation and contempt of such a proud witcher, I confess that \n",
       "we were fighting for money. Our enemy was burning villages which paid us levies and we, \n",
       "greedy for our tributes, challenged them on the field. A trivial reason, a trivial battle, a trivial \n",
       "three thousand corpses pecked to pieces by the crows. And look - instead of being ashamed \n",
       "I'm proud as a peacock that songs are sung about me. Even when sung to such awful music' \n",
       "\n",
       "Again she summoned her parody of a smile full of happiness and kindness, and answered the \n",
       "toast raised to her by lifting her own, empty, goblet. Geralt remained silent. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Let's go on.' Calanthe accepted a pheasant leg offered to her by Drogodar and picked at it \n",
       "gracefully. 'As I said, you've aroused my interest. I've been told that witchers are an \n",
       "interesting caste, but I didn't really believe it. Now I do. When hit you give a note which \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "shows you're fashioned of pure steel, unlike these men moulded from bird shit. Which doesn't, \n",
       "in any way, change the fact that you're here to execute a task. And you'll do it without being \n",
       "so clever.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt didn't smile disrespectfully or nastily, although he very much wanted to. He held his \n",
       "silence. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I thought,' murmured the queen, appearing to give her full attention to the pheasant's thigh, \n",
       "'that you'd say something. Or smile. No? All the better. Can I consider our negotiations \n",
       "concluded?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Unclear tasks,' said the witcher dryly, 'can't be clearly executed.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What's unclear? You did, after all, guess correctly. I have plans regarding a marriage alliance \n",
       "with Skellige. These plans are threatened, and I need you to eliminate the treat. But here your \n",
       "shrewdness ends. The supposition that I mistake your trade for that of a hired thug has piqued \n",
       "me greatly. Accept, Geralt, that I belong to that select group of rulers who know exactly what \n",
       "witchers do, and how they ought to be employed. On the other hand, if someone kills as \n",
       "efficiently as you do, even though not for money, he shouldn't be surprised if people credit \n",
       "him with being a professional in that field. Your fame runs ahead of you, \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt, it's louder than Draig Bon-Dhu's accursed bagpipes, and there are equally few pleasant \n",
       "notes in it.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The bagpipe player, although he couldn't hear the queen's words, finished his concert. The \n",
       "guests rewarded him with an uproarious ovation and dedicated themselves with renewed zeal \n",
       "to the remains of the banquet, recalling battles and making rude jokes about womenfolk. \n",
       "Coodcoodak was making a series of loud noises, but there was no way to tell if these were yet \n",
       "another animal imitation, or an attempt to relieve his overloaded stomach. \n",
       "\n",
       "Eist Tuirseach leant far across the table. 'Your Majesty,' he said, 'there are good reasons, I am \n",
       "sure, for your dedication to the lord from Fourhorn, but it's high time we saw Princess \n",
       "Pavetta. What are we waiting for? Surely not for Crach an Craite to get drunk? And even that \n",
       "moment is almost here.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You're right as usual, Eist,' Calanthe smiled warmly. Geralt was amazed by her arsenal of \n",
       "smiles. 'Indeed, I do have important matters to discuss with the Honourable Ravix. I'll \n",
       "dedicate some time to you too, but you know my principle: duty then pleasure. Haxo!' \n",
       "\n",
       "She raised her hand and beckoned the castellan. Haxo rose without a word, bowed, and \n",
       "quickly ran upstairs, disappearing into the dark gallery. The queen turned to the witcher. \n",
       "\n",
       "'You heard? We've been debating for too long. If Pavetta has stopped preening in front of the \n",
       "looking-glass she'll be here presently. So prick up your ears because I won't repeat this. I want \n",
       "to achieve the ends which,, to a certain degree, you have guessed. There can be no other \n",
       "solution. As for you, you have a choice. You can be forced to act by my command - I don't \n",
       "wish to dwell on the consequences of disobedience, although obedience will be generously \n",
       "rewarded - or you can render me a paid service. Note that I didn't say \"I can buy you\", \n",
       "because I've decided not to offend your witcher's pride. There's a huge difference, isn't there?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'The magnitude of this difference has somehow escaped my notice.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Then pay greater attention. The difference, my dear witcher, \n",
       "\n",
       "is that one who is bought is paid according to the buyer's whim, whereas one who renders a \n",
       "service sets his own price. Is that clear?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'To a certain extent. Let's say, then, that I choose to serve. Surely I should know what that \n",
       "entails?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'No. Only a command has to be specific and explicit. A paid service is different. I'm interested \n",
       "in the results, nothing more. How you achieve it is your business.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt, raising his head, met Mousesack's penetrating black gaze. The druid of Skellige, \n",
       "without taking his eyes from the witcher, was crumbling bread in his hands and dropping it as \n",
       "if lost in thought. Geralt looked down. There on the oak table, crumbs, grains of buckwheat \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "and fragments of lobster shell were moving like ants. They were forming runes which joined \n",
       "up - for a moment - into a word. A question. \n",
       "\n",
       "Mousesack waited without taking his eyes off him. Geralt, almost imperceptibly, nodded. The \n",
       "druid lowered his eyelids and, with a stony face, swiped the crumbs off the table. \n",

       "'Honourable gentlemen!' called the herald. 'Pavetta of Cintra!' \n",

       "\n",
       "Preceded by the castellan and a fair-haired page in a scarlet doublet, the princess descended \n",
       "slowly, her head lowered. The colour of her hair was identical to her mother's - ash-grey - but \n",
       "she wore it braided into two thick plaits which reached below her waist. Pavetta was adorned \n",
       "only with a tiara ornamented with a delicately worked jewel and a belt of tiny golden links \n",
       "which girded her long silvery-blue dress at the hips. \n",
       "\n",
       "Escorted by the page, herald, castellan and Vissegerd, the princess occupied the empty chair \n",
       "between Drogodar and Eist Tuir-seach. The knightly islander immediately filled her goblet \n",
       "and entertained her with conversation. Geralt didn't notice her answer with more than a word. \n",
       "Her eyes were permanently lowered, hidden behind her long lashes even during the noisy \n",
       "toasts raised to her around the table. There was no doubt her beauty had impressed the guests \n",
       "- Crach an Craite stopped shouting and stared at Pavetta in silence, even forgetting his tankard \n",
       "of beer. \n",
       "\n",
       "Windhalm of Attre was also devouring the princess with his eyes, flushing shades of red as \n",
       "though only a few grains in the hourglass separated them from their wedding night. \n",
       "Coodcoodak and the brothers from Strept were studying the girl's petite face, too, with \n",
       "suspicious concentration. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Aha,' said Calanthe quietly, clearly pleased. 'And what do you say, Geralt? The girl has taken \n",
       "after her mother. It's even a shame to waste her on that red-haired lout, Crach. The only hope \n",
       "is that the pup might grow into someone with Eist Tuirseach's class. It's the same blood, after \n",
       "all. Are you listening, Geralt? Cintra has to form an alliance with Skellige because the interest \n",
       "of the state demands it. My daughter has to marry the right person. Those are the results you \n",
       "must ensure me.' \n",
       "\n",

       "'Destiny.' \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "'If it bordered on the possible,' Calanthe drawled, 'I would manage it myself. I wouldn't need \n",
       "the famous Geralt of Rivia. Stop being so clever. Everything can be dealt with - it's only a \n",
       "question of price. Bloody hell, there must be a figure on your witchers' pricelist for work that \n",
       "borders on the impossible. I can guess one, and it isn't low. You ensure me my outcome and I \n",
       "will give you what you ask.' \n",

       "\n",
       "'Yes.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That's better. That's better, Geralt. Your answers are much closer to the ideal. They're \n",

       "Your Majesty,' he said quietly, 'not to repeat what I said earlier about killing people, you do \n",
       "realise that a sword alone will not defeat destiny?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I do,' Calanthe turned her head away. 'A witcher is also necessary. As you see, I took care of \n",
       "that.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Your Maje-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Not another word, Geralt. We've been conspiring for too long. They're looking at us, and Eist \n",
       "is getting angry. Talk to the castellan. Have something to eat. Drink, but not too much. I want \n",
       "you to have a steady hand.' \n",
       "\n",
       "He obeyed. The queen joined a conversation between Eist, Vissegerd and Mousesack, with \n",
       "Pavetta's silent and dreamy participation. Drogodar had put away his lute and was making up \n",
       "for his lost eating time. Haxo wasn't talkative. The voivode with the hard-to-remember name, \n",
       "who must have heard something about the affairs and problems of Fourhorn, politely asked \n",
       "whether the mares were foaling well. Geralt answered yes, much better than the stallions. He \n",
       "wasn't sure if the joke had been well taken, but the voivode didn't ask any more questions. \n",
       "\n",
       "Mousesack's eyes constantly sought the witcher's, but the crumbs on the table didn't move \n",
       "again. \n",
       "\n",
       "Crach an Craite was becoming more and more friendly with the two brothers from Strept. The \n",
       "third, the youngest brother, was paralytic, having tried to match the drinking speed imposed \n",
       "by Draig Bon-Dhu. The skald had emerged from it unscathed. \n",
       "\n",
       "The younger and less important lords gathered at. the end of the table, tipsy, started singing a \n",
       "well-known song out of time \n",
       "\n",
       "about a little goat with horns and a vengeful old woman with no sense of humour. \n",
       "\n",
       "A curly-haired servant and a captain of the guards wearing the gold and blue of Cintra ran up \n",
       "to Vissegerd. The marshal, frowning, listened to their report, rose, and leaned down from \n",
       "behind the throne to murmur something to the queen. Calanthe glanced at Geralt and \n",
       "answered with a single word. Vissegerd leant over even further and whispered something \n",
       "more; the queen looked at him sharply and, without a word, slapped her armrest with an open \n",
       "palm. The marshal bowed and passed the command to the captain of the guards. Geralt didn't \n",
       "hear it but he did notice that Mousesack wriggled uneasily and glanced at Pavetta - the \n",
       "princess was sitting motionless, her head lowered. \n",
       "\n",
       "Heavy footsteps, each accompanied by the clang of metal striking the floor, could be heard \n",
       "over the hum at the table. Everyone raised their heads and turned. \n",
       "\n",
       "The approaching figure was clad in armour of iron sheets and leather treated with wax. His \n",
       "convex, angular, black and blue breast-plate overlapped a segmented apron and short thigh \n",
       "pads. The armour-plated brassards bristled with sharp, steel spikes and the visor, with its \n",
       "densely grated screen extending out in the shape of a dog's muzzle, was covered with spikes \n",
       "like a conker casing. \n",
       "\n",
       "Clattering and grinding, the strange guest approached the table and stood motionless in front \n",
       "of the throne. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Noble queen, honourable gentlemen,' said the newcomer, bowing stiffly. 'Please forgive me \n",
       "for disrupting your ceremonious feast. I am Urcheon of Erlenwald.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Greetings, Urcheon of Erlenwald,' said Calanthe slowly. 'Please take your place at the table. \n",
       "In Cintra we welcome every guest.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Thank you, your Majesty,' Urcheon of Erlenwald bowed once again and touched his chest \n",
       "with a fist clad in an iron gauntlet. 'But I haven't come to Cintra as a guest but on a matter of \n",
       "great importance and urgency. If your Majesty permits I will present my case immediately, \n",
       "without wasting your time.' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'Urcheon of Erlenwald,' said the queen sharply, 'a praiseworthy concern about our time does \n",
       "not justify lack of respect. And such \n",
       "\n",
       "is your speaking to us from behind an iron trellis. Remove your helmet, and we'll endure the \n",
       "time wasted while you do.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'My face, your Majesty, must remain hidden for the time being. With your permission.' \n",
       "\n",
       "An angry ripple, punctuated here and there with the odd curse, ran through the gathered \n",
       "crowd. Mousesack, lowering his head, moved his lips silently. The witcher felt the spell \n",
       "electrify the air for a second, felt it stir his medallion. Calanthe was looking at Urcheon, \n",
       "narrowing her eyes and drumming her fingers on her armrest. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Granted,' she said finally. 'I choose to believe your motive is sufficiently important. So - what \n",
       "brings you here, Urcheon-without-a-face?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Thank you,' said the newcomer. 'But I'm unable to suffer the accusation of lacking respect, so \n",
       "I explain that it is a matter of a knight's vows. I am not allowed to reveal my face before \n",
       "midnight strikes.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Calanthe, raising her hand perfunctorily, accepted his explanation. Urcheon advanced, his \n",
       "spiked armour clanging. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Fifteen years ago,' he announced loudly, 'your husband King Roegner lost his way while \n",
       "hunting in Erlenwald. Wandering around the pathless tracts, he fell from his horse into a \n",
       "ravine and sprained his leg. He lay at the bottom of the gully and called for help but the only \n",
       "answer he got was the hiss of vipers and the howling of approaching werewolves. He would \n",
       "have died without the help he received.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I know what happened,' the queen affirmed. 'If you know it, too, then I guess you are the one \n",
       "who helped him.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Yes. It is only because of me he returned to you in one piece, and well.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I am grateful to you then, Urcheon of Erlenwald. That gratitude is none the lesser for the fact \n",
       "that Roegner, gentleman of my heart and bed, has left this world. Tell me, if the implication \n",
       "that your aid was not disinterested does not offend another of your knightly vows, how I can \n",
       "express my gratitude.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You well know my aid was not disinterested. You know, loo, \n",
       "\n",
       "that I have come to collect the promised reward for saving the king's life.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Oh yes?' Calanthe smiled but green sparks lit up her eyes. 'So you found a man at the bottom \n",
       "of a ravine, defenceless, wounded, at the mercy of vipers and monsters. And only when he \n",
       "promised you a reward did you help? And if he didn't want to or couldn't promise you \n",
       "something, you'd have left him there, and, to this day, I wouldn't know where his bones lay? \n",
       "How noble. No doubt your actions were guided by a particularly chivalrous vow at the time.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The murmur around the hall grew louder. \n",
       "\n",
       "'And today you come for your reward, Urcheon?' continued the queen, smiling even more \n",
       "ominously. 'After fifteen years? No doubt you are counting the interest accrued over this \n",
       "period? This isn't the dwarves' bank, Urcheon. You say Roegner promised you a reward? Ah, \n",
       "well, it will be difficult to get him to pay you. It would be simpler to send you to him, into the \n",
       "other world, to reach an agreement over who owes what. I loved my husband top dearly, \n",
       "Urcheon, to forget that I could have lost him then, fifteen years ago, if he hadn't chosen to \n",
       "bargain with you. The thought of it arouses rather-ill feeling towards you. Masked newcomer, \n",
       "do you know that here in Cintra, in my castle and in my power, you are just as helpless and \n",
       "close to death as Roegner was then, at the bottom of the ravine? What will you propose, what \n",
       "price, what reward will you offer, if I promise you will leave here alive?' \n",
       "\n",
       "The medallion on Geralt's neck twitched. The witcher caught Mousesack's clearly uneasy \n",
       "gaze. He shook his head a little and raised his eyebrows questioningly. The druid also shook \n",
       "his head and, with a barely perceptible move of his curly beard, indicated Urcheon. Geralt \n",
       "wasn't sure. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'Your words, your Majesty,' called Urcheon, 'are calculated to frighten me, to kindle the anger \n",
       "of the honourable gentlemen gathered here, and the contempt of your pretty daughter, Pavetta. \n",
       "But above all, your words are untrue. And you know it!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You accuse me of lying like a dog.' An ugly grimace crept across Calanthe's lips. \n",
       "\n",
       "'You know very well, your Majesty,' the newcomer continued adamantly, 'what happened then \n",
       "in Erlenwald. You know Roegner, once saved, vowed of his own will to give me whatever I \n",
       "asked for. I call upon every one to witness my words! When the king, rescued from his \n",
       "misadventure, reached his retinue, he asked me what I demanded and I answered. I asked him \n",
       "to promise me whatever he had left at home without knowing or expecting it. The king swore \n",
       "it would be so, and on his return to the castle he found you, Calanthe, in labour. Yes, your \n",
       "Majesty, I waited for fifteen years and the interest on my reward has grown. Today I look at \n",
       "the beautiful Pavetta and see that the wait has been worth it! Gentlemen and knights! Some of \n",
       "you have come to Cintra to ask for the princess's hand. You have come in vain. From the day \n",
       "of her birth, by the power of the royal oath, the beautiful Pavetta has belonged to me!' \n",
       "\n",
       "An uproar burst forth among the guests. Some shouted, someone swore, someone else \n",
       "thumped his fist on the table and knocked the dishes over. Wieldhill of Strept pulled a knife \n",
       "out of the roast lamb and waved it about. Crach an Craite, bent over, was clearly trying to \n",
       "break a plank from the table trestle. \n",
       "\n",
       "'That's unheard of!' yelled Vissegerd. 'What proof do you have? Proof?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'The queen's face,' exclaimed Urcheon, extending his hand, 'is the best proof!' \n",
       "\n",
       "Pavetta sat motionless, not raising her head. The air was growing thick with something very \n",
       "strange. The witcher's medallion was tearing at its chain under the tunic. He saw the queen \n",
       "summon a page and whisper a short command. Geralt couldn't hear it, but he was puzzled by \n",
       "the surprise on the boy's face and the fact that the command had to be repeated. The page ran \n",
       "towards the exit. \n",
       "\n",
       "The uproar at the table continued as Eist Tuirseach turned to the queen. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Calanthe,' he said calmly, 'is what he says true?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And if it is,' the queen muttered through her teeth, biting her lips and picking at the green sash \n",
       "on her shoulder, 'so whal?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'If what he says is true,' Eist frowned, 'then the promise will have to be kept.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Is that so?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Or am I to understand,' the islander asked grimly, 'that you treat all promises this lightly, \n",
       "including those which have etched themselves so deeply in my memory?' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt, who had never expected to see Calanthe blush deeply, with tears in her eyes and \n",
       "trembling lips, was surprised. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Eist,' whispered the queen, 'this is different-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Is it, really?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Oh, you son-of-a-bitch!' Crach an Craite yelled unexpectedly, jumping up. 'The last fool who \n",
       "said I'd acted in vain was pinched apart by crabs at the bottom of Allenker bay! I didn't sail \n",
       "here from Skellig to return empty-handed! A suitor has turned up, some son of a trollop! \n",
       "Someone bring me a sword and give that idiot some iron! We'll soon see who-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Maybe you could just shut up, Crach?' Eist snapped scathingly, resting both fists on the table. \n",
       "'Draig Bon-Dhu! I render you responsible for his future behaviour!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And are you going to silence me, too, Tuirseach?' shouted Rainfarn of Attre, standing up. \n",
       "'Who is going to stop me from washing the insult thrown at my prince away with blood? And \n",
       "his son, Windhalm, the only man worthy of Pavetta's hand and bed! Bring the swords! I'll \n",
       "show that Urcheon, or whatever he's called, how we of Attre take revenge for such abuse! I \n",
       "wonder whether anybody or anything can hold me back?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Yes. Regard for good manners,' said Eist Tuirseach calmly. 'It is not proper to start a fight \n",
       "here or challenge anyone without permission from the lady of the house. What is this? Is the \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "throne room of Cintra an inn where you can punch each other's heads and stab each other with \n",
       "knives as the fancy takes you?' \n",
       "\n",
       "Everybody started to shout again, to curse and swear and wave their arms about. But the \n",
       "uproar suddenly stopped, as if cut by a knife, at the short, furious roar of an enraged bison. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Yes,' said Coodcoodak, clearing his throat and rising from his chair. 'Eist has it wrong. This \n",
       "doesn't even look like an inn \n",
       "\n",
       "anymore. It's more like a zoo, so a bison should be at home here. Honourable Calanthe, allow \n",
       "me to offer my opinion.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A great many people, I see,' said Calanthe in a drawling voice, 'have an opinion on this \n",
       "problem and are offering it even without my permission. Strange that you aren't interested in \n",
       "mine? And in my opinion, this bloody castle will sooner collapse on my head than I give my \n",
       "Pavetta to this crank. I haven't the least intention-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Roegner's oath-' Urcheon began, but the queen silenced him, banging her golden goblet on \n",
       "the table. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Roegner's oath means about as much to me as last year's snows! And as for you, Urcheon, I \n",
       "haven't decided whether to allow Crach or Rainfarn to meet you outside, or to simply hang \n",
       "you. You're greatly influencing my decision with your interruption!' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt, still disturbed by the way his medallion was quivering, looked around the hall. \n",
       "Suddenly he saw Pavetta's eyes, emerald green like her mother's. The princess was no longer \n",
       "hiding them beneath her long lashes - she swept them from Mousesack to the witcher, \n",
       "ignoring the others. Mousesack, bent over, was wriggling and muttering something. \n",
       "\n",
       "Coodcoodak, still standing, cleared his throat meaningfully. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Speak,' the queen nodded. 'But be brief \n",
       "\n",
       "'As you command, your Majesty. Noble Calanthe and you, knights! Indeed, Urcheon of \n",
       "Erlenwald made a strange request of King Roegner, a strange reward to demand when the \n",
       "king offered him his wish. But let us not pretend we've never heard of such requests, of the \n",
       "Law of Surprise, as old as humanity itself. Of the price a man who saves another can demand, \n",
       "of the granting of a seemingly impossible wish. \"You will give me the first thing that comes \n",
       "to greet you.\" It might be a dog, you'll say, a halberdier at the gate, even a mother-in-law \n",
       "impatient to holler at her son-in-law when he returns home. Or: \"You'll give me what you find \n",
       "at home yet don't expect.\" After a long journey, honourable gentlemen, and an unexpected \n",
       "return, this could be a lover in the wife's bed. But sometimes it's a child. A child marked out \n",
       "by destiny.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Briefly, Coodcoodak,' Calanthe frowned. \n",
       "\n",
       "'As you command. Sirs! Have you not heard of children marked out by destiny? Was not the \n",
       "legendary hero, Zatret Voruta, given to the dwarves as a child because he was the first person \n",
       "his father met on his return? And Mad Dei, who demanded a traveller give him what he left at \n",
       "home without knowing it? That surprise was the famous Supree, who later liberated Mad Dei \n",
       "from the curse which weighed him down. Remember Zivelena, who became the Queen of \n",
       "Metinna with the help of the gnome Rumplestelt, and in return promised him her first-born? \n",
       "Zivelena didn't keep her promise when Rumplestelt came for his reward and, by using spells, \n",
       "she forced him to run away. Not long after that, both she and the child died of the plague. You \n",
       "do not dice with Destiny with impunity!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Don't threaten me, Coodcoodak,' Calanthe grimaced. 'Midnight is close, the time for ghosts. \n",
       "Can you remember any more legends from your undoubtedly difficult childhood? If not, then \n",
       "sit down.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I ask your Grace,' the baron turned up his long whiskers, 'to allow me to remain standing. I'd \n",
       "like to remind everybody of another legend. It's an old, forgotten legend - we've all probably \n",
       "heard it in our difficult childhoods. In this legend, the kings kept their promises. And we, poor \n",
       "vassals, are only bound to kings by the royal word: treaties, alliances, our privileges and fiefs \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "all rely on it. And now? Are we to doubt all this? Doubt the inviolability of the king's word? \n",
       "Wait until it is worth as much as yesteryear's snow? If this is how things are to be then a \n",
       "difficult old age awaits us after our difficult childhoods!' \n",

       "\n",
       "'This cackler, full of hot air, insults her Majesty!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'The Baron of Tigg is right!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Silence,' Calanthe said suddenly, getting up. 'Let him finish.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I thank you graciously,' bowed Coodcoodak. 'But I have just finished.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Silence fell, strange after the commotion his words had caused. \n",
       "\n",
       "Calanthe was still standing. Geralt didn't think anyone else had noticed her hand shake as she \n",
       "wiped her brow. \n",
       "\n",
       "'My lords,' she said finally, 'you deserve an explanation. Yes, this . . . Urcheon . . . speaks the \n",
       "truth. Roegner did swear to give him that which he did not expect. It looks as if our lamented \n",
       "king was an oaf as far as a woman's affairs are concerned, and couldn't be trusted to count to \n",
       "nine. He confessed the truth on his deathbed, because he knew what I'd do to him if he'd \n",
       "admitted it earlier. He knew what a mother, whose child is disposed of so recklessly, is \n",
       "capable of.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The knights and magnates remained silent. Urcheon stood motionless, like a spiked, iron \n",
       "statue, \n",
       "\n",
       "'And Coodcoodak,' continued Calanthe, 'well, Coodcoodak has reminded me that I am not a \n",
       "mother but a queen. Very well then. As queen, I shall convene a council tomorrow. Cintra is \n",
       "not a tyranny. The council will decide whether a dead king's oath is to decide the fate of the \n",
       "successor to the throne. It will decide whether Pavetta and the throne of Cintra are to be given \n",
       "to a stranger, or to act according to the kingdom's interest.' Calanthe was silent for a moment, \n",
       "looking askance at Geralt. 'And as for the noble knights who have come to Cintra in the hope \n",
       "of the princess's hand . . . It only remains for me to express my deep regret at the cruel \n",
       "disrespect and dishonour they have experienced here, at the ridicule poured on them. I am not \n",
       "to blame.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Amidst the hum of voices which rumbled through the guests, the witcher managed to pick out \n",
       "Eist Tuirseach's whisper. \n",
       "\n",
       "'On all the gods of the sea,' sighed the islander. 'This isn't befitting. This is open incitement to \n",
       "bloodshed. Calanthe, you're simply setting them against each other-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Be quiet, Eist,' hissed the queen furiously, 'because I'll get angry.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Mousesack's black eyes flashed as - with a glance - the druid indicated Rainfarn of Attre who, \n",
       "with a gloomy, grimacing face, was preparing to stand. Geralt reacted immediately, standing \n",
       "up first and banging the chair noisily. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Maybe it will prove unnecessary to convene the council,' he said in ringing tones. \n",
       "\n",
       "Everyone grew silent, watching him with astonishment. Geralt felt Pavetta's emerald eyes on \n",
       "him, he felt Urcheon's gaze fall on him from behind the lattice of his black visor, and he felt \n",
       "the Force surging like a flood-wave and solidifying in the air. He saw how, under the \n",
       "influence of this Force, the smoke from the torches and oil lamps was taking on fantastic \n",
       "forms. He knew that Mousesack saw it too. He also knew that nobody else saw it. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I said,' he repeated calmly, 'that convening the council may not prove necessary. You \n",
       "understand what I have in mind, Urcheon of Erlenwald?' \n",
       "\n",
       "The spiked knight took two grating steps forward. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I do,' he said, his words hollow beneath his helmet. 'It would take a fool not to understand. I \n",
       "heard what the merciful and noble lady Calanthe said a moment ago. She has found an \n",
       "excellent way of getting rid of me. I accept your challenge, knight unknown to me!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I don't recall challenging you,' said Geralt. 'I don't intend to duel you, Urcheon of Erlenwald.' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'Geralt!' called Calanthe, twisting her lips and forgetting to call the witcher Ravix, 'don't \n",
       "overdo it! Don't put my patience to the test!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Or mine,' added Rainfarn ominously. Crach an Craite growled, and Eist Tuirseach \n",
       "meaningfully showed him a clenched fist. Crach growled even louder. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Everyone heard,' spoke Geralt, 'Baron Tigg tell us about the famous heroes taken from their \n",
       "parents on the strength of the same oath that Urcheon received from King Roegner. But why \n",
       "should anyone want such an oath? You know the answer, Urcheon of Erlenwald. It creates a \n",
       "powerful, indissoluble tie of destiny between the person demanding the oath and its object, \n",
       "the child-surprise. Such a child, marked by blind fate, can be destined for extraordinary \n",
       "things. It can play an incredibly important role in the life of the person to whom fate has tied \n",
       "it. That is why, Urcheon, you demanded the prize you claim today. You don't \n",
       "\n",
       "want the throne of Cintra. You want the princess.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'It is exactly as you say, knight unknown to me,' Urcheon laughed out loud. 'That is exactly \n",
       "what I claim! Give me the one who is my destiny!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That,' said Geralt, 'will have to be proved.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You dare doubt it? After the queen confirmed the truth of my words? After what you've just \n",
       "said?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Yes. Because you didn't tell us everything. Roegner knew the power of the Law of Surprise \n",
       "and the gravity of the oath he took. And he took it because he knew law and custom have a \n",
       "power which protects such oaths, ensuring they are only fulfilled when the force of destiny \n",
       "confirms them. I declare, Urcheon, that you have no right to the princess as yet. You will win \n",
       "her only when-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'When what?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'When the princess herself agrees to leave with you. This is what the Law of Surprise states. It \n",
       "is the child's, not the parent's, consent which confirms the oath, which proves that the child \n",
       "was born under the shadow of destiny. That's why you returned after fifteen years, Urcheon, \n",
       "and that's the condition King Roegner stipulated in his oath.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Who are you?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I am Geralt of Rivia.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Who are you, Geralt of Rivia, to claim to be an oracle in matters of laws and customs?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'He knows this law better than anyone else,' Mousesack said in a hoarse voice, 'because it \n",
       "applied to him once. He was taken from his home because he was what his father hadn't \n",
       "expected to find on his return. Because he was destined for other things. And by the power of \n",
       "destiny he became what he is.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And what is he?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A witcher.' \n",
       "\n",
       "In the silence that reigned the guardhouse bell struck, announcing midnight in a dull tone. \n",
       "Everyone shuddered and raised their heads. Mousesack watched Geralt with surprise. But it \n",
       "was Urcheon who flinched most noticeably and moved uneasily. His \n",
       "\n",
       "hands, clad in their armour gauntlets, fell to his sides lifelessly, and the spiked helmet swayed \n",
       "unsteadily. \n",
       "\n",
       "The strange, unknown Force suddenly grew thicker, filling the hall like a grey mist. \n",
       "\n",
       "'It's true,' said Calanthe. 'Geralt, present here, is a witcher. His trade is worthy of respect and \n",
       "esteem. He has sacrificed himself to protect us from monsters and nightmares born in the \n",
       "night, those sent by powers ominous and harmful to man. He kills the horrors and monsters \n",
       "that await us in the forests and ravines. And those which have the audacity to enter our \n",
       "dwellings.' Urcheon was silent. 'And so,' continued the queen, raising her ringed hand, let the \n",
       "law be fulfilled, let the oath which you, Urcheon of Erlenwald, insist should be satisfied, be \n",
       "satisfied. Midnight has struck. Your vow no longer binds you. Lift your visor. Before my \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "daughter expresses her will, before she decides her destiny, let her see your face. We all wish \n",
       "to see your face.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Urcheon of Erlenwald slowly raised his armoured hand, pulled at the helmet's fastenings, \n",
       "grabbed it by the iron horn and threw it against the floor with a crash. Someone shouted, \n",
       "someone swore, someone sucked in their breath with a whistle. On the queen's face appeared \n",
       "a wicked, very wicked, smile. A cruel smile of triumph. \n",
       "\n",
       "Above the wide, semi-circular breastplate two bulbous, black, button eyes looked out. Eyes \n",
       "set to either side of a blunt, elongated muzzle covered in reddish bristles and full of sharp \n",
       "white fangs. Urcheon's head and neck bristled with a brush of short, grey, twitching prickles. \n",
       "\n",
       "'This is how I look,' spoke the creature, 'which you well knew, Calanthe. Roegner, in telling \n",
       "you of his oath, wouldn't have omitted describing me. Urcheon of Erlenwald to whom - \n",
       "despite my appearance - Roegner swore his oath. You prepared well for my arrival, queen. \n",
       "Your own vassals have pointed out your haughty and contemptuous refusal to keep Roegner's \n",
       "word. When your attempt to set the other suitors on me didn't succeed, you still had a killer \n",
       "witcher in reserve, ready at your right-hand. And finally, \n",
       "\n",
       "common, low deceit. You wanted to humiliate me, Calanthe. Know that it is yourself you \n",
       "have humiliated.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Enough,' Calanthe stood up and rested her clenched fist on her hip. 'Let's put an end to this. \n",
       "Pavetta! You see who, or rather what, is standing in front of you, claiming you for himself. In \n",
       "accordance with the Law of Surprise and eternal custom, the decision is yours. Answer. One \n",
       "word from you is enough. Yes, and you become the property, the conquest, of this monster. \n",
       "No, and you will never have to see him again.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The Force pulsating in the hall was squeezing Geralt's temples like an iron vice, buzzing in \n",
       "his ears, making the hair on his neck stand on end. The witcher looked at Mousesack's \n",
       "whitening knuckles, clenched at the edge of the table. At the trickle of sweat running down \n",
       "the queen's cheek. At the breadcrumbs on the table, moving like insects, forming runes, \n",
       "dispersing and again gathering into one word: CAREFUL! \n",
       "\n",
       "'Pavetta!' Calanthe repeated. 'Answer. Do you choose to leave with this creature?' \n",
       "\n",
       "Pavetta raised her head. 'Yes.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The Force filling the hall echoed her, rumbling hollowly in the arches of the vault. No one, \n",
       "absolutely no one, made the slightest sound. \n",
       "\n",
       "Calanthe very slowly, collapsed into her throne. Her face was completely expressionless. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Everyone heard,' Urcheon's calm voice resounded in the silence. 'You, too, Calanthe. As did \n",
       "you, witcher, cunning, hired thug. My rights have been established. Truth and destiny have \n",
       "triumphed over lies and deviousness. What do you have left, noble queen, disguised witcher? \n",
       "Cold steel?' No one answered. 'I'd like to leave with Pavetta immediately,' continued Urcheon, \n",
       "his bristles stirring as he snapped his jaw shut, 'but I won't deny myself one small pleasure. It \n",
       "is you, Calanthe, who will lead your daughter here to me and place her white hand in mine.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Calanthe slowly turned her head in the witcher's direction. Her eyes expressed a command. \n",
       "Geralt didn't move, sensing that the Force condensing in the air was concentrated on him. \n",
       "Only on \n",
       "\n",
       "him. Now he understood. The queen's eyes narrowed, her lips quivered . . . \n",
       "\n",
       "'What?! What's this?' yelled Crach an Craite, jumping up. 'Her white hand? In his? The \n",
       "princess with this bristly stinker? With this . . . pig's snout?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And I wanted to fight him like a knight!' Rainfarn chimed in. 'This horror, this beast! Loose \n",
       "the dogs on him! The dogs!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Guards!' cried Calanthe. \n",
       "\n",
       "Everything happened at once. Crach an Craite seized a knife from the table and knocked his \n",
       "chair over with a crash. Obeying Eist's command Draig Bon-Dhu, without a thought, whacked \n",
       "the back of his head with his bagpipes, as hard as he could. Crach dropped onto the table \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "between a sturgeon in grey sauce and the few remaining arched ribs of a roast boar. Rainfarn \n",
       "leapt towards Urcheon, flashing a dagger drawn from his sleeve. Coodcoodak, springing up, \n",
       "kicked a stool under his feet which Rainfarn jumped agilely, but a moment's delay was \n",
       "enough - Urcheon deceived him with a short feint and forced him to his knees with a mighty \n",
       "blow from his armoured fist. Coodcoodak fell to snatch the dagger from Rainfarn but was \n",
       "stopped by Prince Windhalm, who clung to his thigh like a bloodhound. \n",
       "\n",
       "Guards, armed with guisarmes and lances, ran in from the entrance. Calanthe, upright and \n",
       "threatening, with an authoritative, abrupt gesture indicated Urcheon to them. Pavetta started to \n",
       "shout, Eist Tuirseach to curse. Everyone jumped up, not quite knowing what to do. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Kill him!' shouted the queen. \n",
       "\n",
       "Urcheon, huffing angrily and baring his fangs, turned to face the attacking guards. He was \n",
       "unarmed but clad in spiked steel, from which the points of the guisarmes bounced with a \n",
       "clang. But the blows knocked him back, straight onto Rainfarn, who was just getting up and \n",
       "immobilised him by grabbing his legs. Urcheon let out a roar and, with his iron elbow-guards, \n",
       "deflected the blades aimed at his head. Rainfarn jabbed him with his dagger but the blade slid \n",
       "off the breast-plate. The guards, crossing their spear-shafts, pinned him to the sculpted \n",
       "chimney. Rainfarn, who was \n",
       "\n",
       "hanging onto his belt, found a chink in the armour and dug the dagger into it. Urcheon curled \n",
       "up. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Dunyyyyyyy!' Pavetta shrilled as she jumped onto the chair. \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher, sword in hand, sprang onto the table and ran towards the fighting men, knocking \n",
       "plates, dishes and goblets all over the place. He knew there wasn't much time. Pavetta's cries \n",
       "were sounding more and more unnatural. Rainfarn was raising his dagger to stab again. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt cut, springing from the table into a crouch. Rainfarn wailed and staggered to the wall. \n",
       "The witcher spun and, with the centre of his blade, slashed a guard who was trying to dig the \n",
       "sharp tongue of his lance between Urcheon's apron and breastplate. The guard tumbled to the \n",
       "ground, losing his helmet. More guards came running in from the entrance. \n",
       "\n",
       "'This is not befitting!' roared Eist Tuirseach, grabbing a chair. He shattered the unwieldly \n",
       "piece of furniture against the floor with great force and, with what remained in his hand, \n",
       "threw himself at those advancing on Urcheon. \n",
       "\n",
       "Urcheon, caught by two guisarme hooks at the same time, collapsed with a clang, cried out \n",
       "and huffed as he was dragged along the floor. A third guard raised his lance to stab down and \n",
       "Geralt cut him in the temple with the point of his sword. Those dragging Urcheon stepped \n",
       "back quickly, throwing down their guisarmes, while those approaching from the entrance \n",
       "backed away from the remnants of chair brandished by Eist like the magic sword Balmur in \n",
       "the hand of the legendary Zatreta Voruta. \n",
       "\n",
       "Pavetta's cries reached a peak and suddenly broke off. Geralt, sensing what was about to \n",
       "happen, fell to the floor watching for a greenish flash. He felt an excruciating pain in his ears, \n",
       "heard a terrible crash and a horrifying wail ripped from numerous throats. And then the \n",
       "princess's even, monotonous and vibrating cry. \n",
       "\n",
       "The table, scattering dishes and food all around, was rising and spinning; heavy chairs were \n",
       "flying around the hall and shattering against the walls; tapestries and hangings were flapping, \n",
       "raising clouds of dust. Cries and the dry crack of guisarme shafts snapping like sticks came \n",
       "from the entrance. \n",
       "\n",
       "The throne, with Calanthe sitting on it, sprang up and flew across the hall like an arrow, \n",
       "smashing into the wall with a crash and falling apart. The queen slid to the floor like a ragged \n",
       "puppet. Eist Tuirseach, barely on his feet, threw himself towards her, took her in his arms and \n",
       "sheltered her from the hail pelting against the walls and floor with his body. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt, grasping the medallion in his hand, slithered as quickly as he could towards \n",
       "Mousesack, miraculously still on his knees, who was lifting a short hawthorn wand with a \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "rat's skull affixed to the tip. On the wall behind the druid a tapestry depicting the siege and \n",
       "fire of Fortress Ortagar was burning with very real flames. \n",
       "\n",
       "Pavetta wailed. Turning round and round, she lashed everything and everybody with her cries \n",
       "as if with a whip. Anyone who tried to stand tumbled to the ground or was flattened against \n",
       "the wall. An enormous silver sauce-boat in the shape of a many-oared vessel with an upturned \n",
       "bow came whistling through the air in front of Geralt's eyes and knocked down the voivode \n",
       "with the hard-to-remember name just as he was trying to dodge it. Plaster rained down silently \n",
       "as the table rotated beneath the ceiling, with Crach an Graite flattened on it and throwing \n",
       "down vile curses. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt crawled to Mousesack and they hid behind the heap formed by Fodcat of Strept, a \n",
       "barrel of beer, Drogodar, a chair and Drogodar's lute. \n",
       "\n",
       "'It's pure, primordial Force!' the druid yelled over the racket and clatter. 'She's got no control \n",
       "over it!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I know!' Geralt yelled back. A roast pheasant with a few striped feathers still stuck in its \n",
       "rump, fell from nowhere and thumped him in the back. \n",
       "\n",
       "'She has to be restrained! The walls are starting to crack!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I can see!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Ready?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Yes!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'One! Two! Now!' \n",
       "\n",
       "They both hit her simultaneously, Geralt with the Sign of Aard and Mousesack with a terrible, \n",
       "three-staged curse powerful enough \n",
       "\n",
       "to make the floor melt. The chair on which the princess was standing disintegrated into \n",
       "splinters. Pavetta barely noticed - she hung in the air within a transparent green sphere. \n",
       "Without ceasing to shout, she turned her head towards them and her petite face shrunk into a \n",
       "sinister grimace. \n",
       "\n",
       "'By all the demons-!' roared Mousesack. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Careful!' shouted the witcher, curling up. 'Block her, Mousesack! Block her or it's the end of \n",
       "us!' \n",
       "\n",
       "The table thudded heavily to the ground, shattering its trestle and everything beneath it. Crach \n",
       "an Craite, who was lying on the table, was thrown into the air. A heavy rain of plates and \n",
       "remnants of food fell; crystal carafes exploded as they hit the ground. The cornice broke away \n",
       "from the wall, rumbling like thunder, making the floors of the castle quake. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Everything's letting go!' Mousesack shouted, aiming his wand at the princess. 'The whole \n",
       "Force is going to fall on us!' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt, with a blow of his sword, deflected a huge double-pronged fork which was flying \n",
       "straight at the druid. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Block it, Mousesack!' \n",
       "\n",
       "Emerald eyes sent two flashes of green lightning at them. They coiled into blinding, whirling \n",
       "funnels from the centres of which the Force - like a battering ram which exploded the skull, \n",
       "put out the eyes and paralysed the breath - descended on them. Together with the Force, \n",
       "glass, majolica, platters, candlesticks, bones, nibbled loaves of bread, planks, slats and \n",
       "smouldering firewood from the hearth poured over them. Crying wildly like a great \n",
       "capercaillie, Castellan Haxo flew over their heads. The enormous head of a boiled carp \n",
       "splattered against Geralt's chest, on the bear passant sable and damsel of Fourhorn. \n",
       "\n",
       "Through Mousesack's wall-shattering curses, through his own shouting and the wailing of the \n",
       "wounded, the din, clatter and racket, through Pavetta's wailing, the witcher suddenly heard the \n",
       "most terrible sound. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Coodcoodak, on his knees, was strangling Draig Bon-Dhu's bagpipes with his hands, while, \n",
       "with his head thrown back, he shouted over the monstrous sounds emerging from the bag, \n",
       "wailed \n",
       "\n",
       "and roared, cackled and croaked, bawled and squawked in a cacophony of sounds made by all \n",
       "known, unknown, domestic, wild and mythical animals. \n",
       "\n",
       "Pavetta fell silent, horrified, and looked at the baron with her mouth agape. The Force eased \n",
       "off abruptly. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Now!' yelled Mousesack, waving his wand. 'Now, witcher!' \n",
       "\n",
       "They hit her. The greenish sphere surrounding the princess burst under their blow like a soap \n",
       "bubble and the vacuum instantly sucked in the Force raging through the room. Pavetta flopped \n",
       "heavily to the ground and started to weep. \n",
       "\n",
       "After the pandemonium a moment's silence rang in their ears; then, with difficulty, \n",
       "laboriously, voices started to break through the rubble and destruction, through the broken \n",

       "\n",
       "'Cuach op arse, ghoul y badraigh mal an cuach,' spat Crach an Craite, spraying blood from his \n",

       "sits a troll and demands every passerby pays him. Those who refuse have a leg injured, \n",
       "sometimes both. So I go to the alderman: \"How much will you give me for that troll?\" He's \n",
       "amazed. \"What are you talking about?\" he asks, \"Who will repair the bridge if the troll's not \n",
       "there? He repairs it regularly with the sweat of his brow, solid work, first rate. It's cheaper to \n",
       "pay his toll.\" So I ride on, and what do I see? A forktail. Not very big, about four yards nose-\n",
       "tip to tail-tip. It's flying, carrying a sheep in its talons. I go to the village. \"How much?\" I ask, \n",
       "\"will you pay me for the forktail?\" The peasants fall on their knees. \"No!\" they shout, \"it's our \n",

       "our hamlet, and skin us.\" I ride on, and I'm getting hungrier and hungrier. I ask around for \n",
       "work. Certainly it's there, but what work? To catch a rusalka for one man, a nymph for \n",
       "another, a dryad for a third . . . They've gone completely mad - the villages are teeming with \n",
       "girls but they want humanoids. Another asks me to kill a mecopteran and bring him a bone \n",
       "from its hand because, crushed and poured into a soup, it cures impotence-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That's rubbish,' interrupted Dandilion. 'I've tried it. It doesn't strengthen anything and it makes \n",

       "somewhat. The demand for poetry and the sound of lute strings will never decline. It's worse \n",
       "with your trade. You witchers, after all, deprive yourselves of work, slowly but surely. The \n",
       "better and the more conscientiously you work, the less work there is for you. After all, your \n",

       "the last draconid for a thousand miles and no longer gives rise to fear but rather to compassion \n",
       "and nostalgia for times passed. The troll under the bridge gets on with people. He's not a \n",

       "The next few minutes passed in a recital of the monsters which plagued the local peasants \n",

       "which runs around in the forest, of hobolds which wear red hats and about a dangerous pike \n",
       "which tears linen from women's hands as they wash it - and just you wait and it'll be at the \n",
       "women themselves. They weren't spared hearing that old Nan the Hag flies on a broom at \n",
       "night and performs abortions in the day, that the miller tampers with the flour by mixing it \n",
       "with powdered acorns and that a certain Duda believed the royal steward to be a thief and \n",

       "\n",
       "Geralt listened to all this calmly, nodding with feigned interest, \n",

       "stretched over the orchard fence, 'all the way you've been complaining about it being harder \n",
       "and harder to find work. Yet from what I just heard, it looks as if you could work here without \n",
       "break until winter. You'd make a penny or two, and I'd have some beautiful subjects for my \n",

       "\n",
       "'No,' the witcher agreed. 'They weren't lying. They firmly believed it all. Which doesn't \n",

       "They rode out beyond the last fences, on to a highway between beds yellow with oilseed and \n",
       "cornfields rolling in the wind. Loaded carts travelled past them in the opposite direction. The \n",
       "bard pulled his leg over the saddle-bow, rested his lute on his knee and strummed nostalgic \n",
       "tunes, waving from time to time at the giggling, scantily clad girls wandering along the sides \n",

       "'Geralt,' he said suddenly, 'but monsters do exist. Maybe not as many as before, maybe they \n",
       "don't lurk behind every tree in the forest, but they are there. They exist. So how do you \n",

       "\n",
       "'People,' Geralt turned his head, like to invent monsters and monstrosities. Then they seem \n",
       "less monstrous themselves. When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal, beat their wives, starve an \n",
       "old woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe or riddle the last existing unicorn with \n",
       "arrows, they like to think that the Bane entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than \n",
       "they are. They feel better then. They find it easier to live.' \n",
       "\n",
       "I'll remember that,' said Dandilion, after a moment's silence. 'I'll find some rhymes and \n",
       "compose a ballad about it.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Do. But don't expect a great applause.' \n",
       "\n",
       "They rode slowly but lost the last cottages of the hamlet from sight. Soon they had climbed \n",
       "the row of forested hills. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Ha.' Dandilion halted his horse and looked around. 'Look, Geralt. Isn't it beautiful here? \n",
       "Idyllic, damn it. A feast for the eyes!' \n",
       "\n",
       "The land sloped gently down to a mosaic of flat, even fields picked out in variously coloured \n",
       "crops. In the middle, round and regular like a leaf of clover, sparkled the deep waters of three \n",
       "lakes surrounded by dark strips of alder thickets. The horizon was traced by a misty blue line \n",
       "of mountains rising above the black, shapeless stretch of forest. \n",

       "\n",
       "The road led straight towards the lakes alongside dykes and ponds hidden by alder trees and \n",
       "filled with quacking mallards, garganeys, herons and grebes. The richness of bird life was \n",
       "surprising alongside the signs of human activity - the dykes were well maintained and \n",
       "covered with fascines, while the sluice gates had been reinforced with stones and beams. The \n",
       "outlet boxes, which were not in the least rotten, trickled merrily with water. \n",
       "\n",
       "Canoes and jetties were visible in the reeds by the lakes and bars of set nets and fish-pots \n",
       "were poking out of the deep waters. \n",
       "\n",
       "Dandilion suddenly looked around. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Someone's following us,' he said, excited. 'In a cart!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Incredible,' scoffed the witcher without looking around. 'In a cart? And I thought that the \n",
       "locals rode on bats.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Do you know what?' growled the troubadour. 'The closer we get to the edge of the world, the \n",

       "'And what is that?' \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",

       "Nettly.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Tie ye the horses to the frame, and sit yerselves down in the cart,' the peasant proposed. 'It be \n",
       "more comfortable for ye. Why rack yer arses on the saddle?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Too true.' \n",
       "\n",
       "They climbed onto the cart. The witcher stretched out comfortably on the straw. Dandilion, \n",
       "evidently afraid of getting his elegant green jerkin dirty, sat on the plank. Nettly clucked his \n",
       "tongue at the horses and the vehicle clattered along the beam-reinforced dyke. \n",

       "\n",
       "'How did you deduce that?' Dandilion was curious. 'From the fact that he's sitting in an \n",

       "\n",
       "'It's a question of the special qualities of hemp. A field of this size emits a strong aura against \n",

       "'Intelligently,' Dandilion sniffed. 'Craftily. With a hounding, for example. I'd chase the devil \n",

       "with it and wiped his sweaty brow. The humid, stifling heat, intensified by the smell of grass \n",
       "and weeds in blossom, dominated the thicket. The path curved a little and, just beyond the \n",

       "'Look, Dandilion.' \n",
       "\n",
       "In the very centre of the clearing lay a large, flat stone, and on it stood several clay bowls. An \n",

       "The creature was about half a rod tall with bulging eyes and a goat's horns and beard. The \n",
       "mouth, a soft, busy slit, also brought a chewing goat to mind. Its nether regions were covered \n",
       "with long, thick, dark-red hair right down to the cleft hooves. The devil had a long tail ending \n",
       "in a brush-like tassel which wagged energetically. \n",

       "back of his head. Geralt threw himself to one side, among the hemp, but didn't avoid the ball \n",
       "that hit him in the shoulder. The goathorn's aim was true and he appeared to have an endless \n",
       "supply of balls. The witcher, stumbling through the thicket, heard yet another triumphant bleat \n",

       "\n",
       "Ah,' Geralt opened the book at random. The picture on the torn page depicted a dappled pig \n",

       "\n",
       "The woman, controlling her shaking hands with difficulty, turned several pages. The witcher \n",
       "and the poet leaned over the table. The etching did, in effect, show the ball-thrower: horned, \n",

       "parchment. 'Next, takest thou of iron balls a second fistful. Of honey an utricle, of birch tar a \n",
       "second. Of grey soap a firkin; of soft cheese another. There where the deovel dwelleth, goest \n",
       "thou when 'tis night. Commenceth then to eat the nuts. Anon, the deovel who hath great greed, \n",

       "\n",
       "\n",

       "for two years, the fools ye be!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Careful,' smiled the witcher. 'You're starting to fall into their jargon. It's infectious.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Thank you.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt suddenly raised his head and looked into the eyes of the girl standing by the woman. \n",
       "Lille didn't lower, her eyes. They were pale and wildly blue. Why are you bringing the devil \n",

       "She be strange. She won't answer you, don't force her.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt kept looking into Lille's eyes, and Lille still met his gaze. He felt a shiver run down his \n",
       "back and creep along his shoulders. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Why didn't you attack the devil with stancheons and pitchforks,' he raised his voice. 'Why \n",
       "didn't you set a trap for him? If you'd wanted to, his goat's head would already be spiked on a \n",
       "pole to frighten crows away. You warned me not to kill him. Why? You forbade it, didn't you, \n",
       "Lille?' \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "'Who is she, honourable Dhun?' the witcher demanded as the door closed behind Lille and the \n",

       "myself to you in any way. You have no reason to believe that you've bought yourself a \n",
       "witcher who, for a silver penny or three halves, will do what you can't do yourselves. Or don't \n",
       "want to do. Or aren't allowed to. No, honourable Dhun. You have not bought yourself a \n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "went on stealing. And when we started to hide our supplies in shops and sheds, well locked \n",

       "'I've noticed.' Geralt twisted his lips in a smile. 'The woman can only waggle her chin and \n",
       "mumble a text which she doesn't understand herself. And you stare at the girl, with gaping \n",
       "mouths, as if she were the statue of a goddess. You avoid her eyes but try to guess her wishes. \n",

       "villages, didn't enjoy the favour of those noblemen who collected levies and profited from \n",
       "farming. Farmers always consulted prophetesses on everything and believed them, blindly and \n",
       "boundlessly. Decisions based on their advice were often completely contrary to the politics of \n",
       "lords and overlords. Geralt had heard of incomprehensible decrees - the slaughter of entire \n",
       "pedigree herds, the cessation of sowing or harvesting, and even the migration of entire \n",
       "villages. Local lords therefore opposed the superstition, often brutally, and freemen very \n",
       "quickly learnt to hide the Wise Ones. But they didn't stop listening to their advice. Because \n",

       "have nay even squeaked to him of the deovel, the reason being the steward be ruthless and \n",

       "man wins. If you want to win with me, prove you're the best. Instead of coming to an \n",
       "understanding, we'll have competitions. The \n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "'No!' protested the devil. 'I might not guess it, after all. Do you take me for a fool?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'No,' Geralt shook his head. 'I take you for a spiteful, arrogant dope. We're going to play quite \n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Geralt stooped in a lightning throw; the one-inch iron ball whizzed sharply through the air and \n",
       "thwacked the sylvan straight between the horns. The creature collapsed onto his back as if hit \n",
       "by a thunderbolt. Geralt dived between the poles and grabbed him by one shaggy leg. The \n",
       "sylvan bleated and kicked. The witcher sheltered his head with his arm, but to little effect. The \n",
       "sylvan, despite his mean posture, kicked with the strength of an enraged mule. The witcher \n",
       "tried and failed to catch a kicking hoof. The sylvan flapped, thrashed his hands on the ground \n",
       "and kicked him again in the forehead. The witcher cursed, feeling the sylvan's leg slip from \n",
       "his fingers. Both, having parted, rolled in opposite directions, kicked the poles with a crash \n",
       "and tangled themselves up in the creeping hemp. \n",
       "\n",
       "The sylvan was the first to jump up, and, lowering his horned head, charged. But Geralt was \n",
       "already on his feet and effortlessly dodged the attack, grabbed the creature by a horn, tugged \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "hard, threw him to the ground and crushed him with his knees. The sylvan bleated and spat \n",
       "straight into the witcher's eyes like a camel suffering from excess saliva. The witcher \n",
       "instinctively stepped back without releasing the devil's horns. The sylvan, trying to toss his \n",
       "head, kicked with both hooves at once and - strangely - hit the mark with both. Geralt swore \n",
       "nastily, but didn't release his grip. He pulled the sylvan up, pinned him to the creaking poles \n",
       "and kicked him in a shaggy knee with all his might, then he leant over and spat right into his \n",

       "Shall we play on?' The sylvan gurgled, howled and spat fiercely, but Geralt held him firmly \n",
       "by the horns and pressed his head down hard, making the spittle hit the sylvan's own hooves, \n",
       "which tore at the ground, sending up clouds of dust and weeds. \n",
       "\n",
       "The next few minutes passed in an intense skirmish and exchange of insults and kicks. If \n",

       "\n",
       "The force of the next kick tore the combatants apart and threw them in opposite directions, \n",
       "into the hemp thicket. The sylvan got up before the witcher and rushed to escape, limping \n",
       "heavily. Geralt, panting and wiping his brow, rushed in pursuit. They forced their way \n",
       "through the hemp and ran into the hops. The witcher heard the pounding of a galloping horse, \n",
       "the sound he'd been waiting for. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Here, Dandilion! Here!' he yelled. 'In the hops!' \n",
       "\n",
       "He saw the mount breast right in front of him and was knocked over. He bounced off the \n",
       "horse as though it were a rock and tumbled onto his back. The world darkened. He managed \n",
       "to roll to the side, behind the hop poles, to avoid the hooves. He sprung up nimbly but another \n",
       "rider rode into him, knocking him down \n",
       "\n",
       "again. Then suddenly, someone threw themselves at him and pinned him to the ground. \n",
       "\n",
       "Then there was a flash, and a piercing pain in the back of his head. \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "There was sand on his lips. When he tried to spit it out he realised he was lying face-down on \n",
       "the ground. And he was tied up. He raised his head a little and heard voices. \n",
       "\n",
       "He was lying on the forest floor, by a pine tree. Some twenty paces away stood unsaddled \n",
       "horses. They were obscured behind the feathery fronds of ferns, but one of those horses was, \n",
       "without a doubt, Dandilion's chestnut. \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "'That's not all,' said the bleating voice, which could only be the sylvan devil. 'Look at this, \n",
       "Galarr. It looks like beans but it's completely white. And the size of it! And this, this is called \n",
       "oilseed. They make oil from it.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt squeezed his eyes shut, then opened them again. No, it wasn't a dream. The devil and \n",

       "\n",
       "'Flaxseed. Flax, you know? You make shirts from flax. It's much cheaper than silk, and more \n",

       "\n",
       "'As long as it takes root, this flax of yours; as long as it doesn't go to waste like the turnip,' \n",

       "\n",
       "In the middle of the glade stood the sylvan devil with - as he now knew - the sweet name of \n",
       "Torque. He was busy loading sacks, bags and packs on to the horses. He was being helped by \n",
       "a slim, tall man who could only be Galarr. The latter, hearing the witcher move, turned \n",
       "around. His hair was black with a distinct hint of dark blue. He had sharp features, big, bright \n",
       "eyes and pointed ears. \n",
       "\n",
       "Galarr was an elf. An elf from the mountains. A pure-blooded Aen Seidhe, a representative of \n",
       "the Old People. \n",
       "\n",
       "Galarr wasn't alone. Six more sat at the edge of the glade. One was busy emptying Dandilion's \n",
       "packs, another strummed the troubadour's lute. The remainder, gathered around an untied \n",
       "sack, were greedily devouring turnips and raw carrots. \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "The elf standing over Dandilion had black eyes and raven hair, which fell luxuriantly over her \n",
       "shoulders, except for two thin plaits braided at her temples. She was wearing a short leather \n",
       "camisole over a loose shirt of green satin, and tight woollen leggings tucked into riding boots. \n",

       "'Did you hear?' The elf turned to her companion, the tall Seidhe who, not bothering to check \n",
       "Geralt's knots, was strumming away at Dandilion's lute with an expression of indifference on \n",
       "his long face. 'Did you hear, Vanadain? The ape-man can talk! He can even be impertinent!' \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "The elf leant over Geralt. She had long lashes, an unnaturally pale complexion and parched, \n",
       "cracked lips. She wore a necklace of carved golden birch pieces on a thong, wrapped around \n",
       "her neck several times. \n",
       "\n",

       "comes.' \n",
       "\n",
       "He didn't answer. \n",
       "\n",
       "I'd much rather stab you from close-up, looking you in the eyes,' continued the elf. 'But you \n",
       "stink most hideously, human, so I'll shoot you.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'As you wish.' The witcher shrugged, as far as the knots let him. 'Do as you like, noble Aen \n",
       "Seidhe. You shouldn't miss a tied-up, motionless target.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The elf stood over him, legs spread, and leant down, flashing her teeth. \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "'Thaesse!' shrieked Toruviel, and kicked the witcher again. The tall Seidhe tore so violently at \n",
       "the strings that one snapped with a protracted whine. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Enough of that! Enough, for gods' sake!' Dandilion yelled fretfully, wriggling and tumbling in \n",
       "the ropes. 'Why are you bullying him, you stupid whore? Leave us alone! And you leave my \n",
       "lute alone, all right?' \n",
       "\n",
       "Toruviel turned to him with an angry grimace on her cracked lips. 'Musician!' she growled. 'A \n",
       "human, yet a musician! A luten-ist!' \n",
       "\n",
       "Without a word, she pulled the instrument from the tall elf's hand, forcefully smashed the lute \n",

       "Toruviel lost her balance and fell on top of him. \n",
       "\n",

       "such force that the vertebrae in his neck cracked and, with all his might, butted her in the face \n",
       "with his forehead. Toruviel howled and struggled. \n",
       "\n",
       "They pulled him off her brutally and, tugging at his clothes and hair, lifted him. One of them \n",
       "struck him; he felt rings cut the skin over his cheekbone and the forest danced and swam in \n",
       "front of his eyes. He saw Toruviel lurch to her knees, blood pouring from her nose and mouth. \n",

       "and dropped her head between her knees. \n",
       "\n",
       "The tall elf in the jacket adorned with colourful feathers took the dagger from her hand and \n",

       "blood from his forehead, which he'd cut against Toruviel's teeth, poured into his eye-sockets. \n",

       "Geralt turned his head as far as the fist clutching his hair permitted. \n",
       "\n",
       "The horse which had just reached the glade was as white as snow, its mane long, soft and \n",
       "silky as a woman's hair. The hair of the rider sitting in the sumptuous saddle was identical in \n",
       "colour, pulled back at the forehead by a bandana studded with sapphires. \n",
       "\n",
       "Torque, bleating now and then, ran up to the horse, caught hold of the stirrup and showered \n",
       "the white-haired elf with a torrent of words. The Seidhe interrupted him with an authoritative \n",
       "gesture and jumped down from his saddle. He approached Toruviel, who was being supported \n",
       "by two elves, and carefully removed the bloodied handkerchief from her face. Toruviel gave a \n",
       "heartrending groan. The Seidhe shook his head and approached the witcher. \n",
       "\n",
       "His burning black eyes, shining like stars in his pale face, had dark rings beneath them, as if \n",
       "he had not slept for several nights in a row. \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",

       "'Our sylvan friend is on a special mission in the Valley of Flowers. Am I right, Torque? At the \n",

       "'Whatever I can,' bleated Torque. 'Everything they need. And show me something they don't \n",

       "wryly. 'It's all the same to him who he takes his revenge on. Don't be deluded by his noble \n",
       "bearing and elaborate speech, Dandilion. He's no different than the black-eyes who knocked \n",
       "us down. He has to unload his powerless hatred on somebody.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The elf picked up Dandilion's shattered lute. For a moment, he looked at the ruined instrument \n",
       "in silence, and finally threw it into the bushes. \n",

       "'If I wanted to give vent to hatred or a desire for revenge,' he said, playing with a pair of soft \n",
       "white leather gloves, 'I'd storm the valley at night, burn down the village and kill the villagers. \n",
       "Childishly simple. They don't even put out a guard. They don't see or hear us when they come \n",

       "behind a tree? But we're not hunting you. It is you, man with strange eyes, who is hunting our \n",

       "\n",
       "'The world is huge,' repeated the elf. 'That's true, human. But you have changed this world. At \n",
       "first, you used force to change it. You treated it as you treat anything that falls into your \n",

       "\n",
       "starving. Yes, we are threatened with annihilation. The sun shines differently, the air is \n",
       "different, water is not as it used to be. The things we used to eat, made use of, are dying, \n",
       "diminishing, deteriorating. We never cultivated the land. Unlike you humans we never tore at \n",
       "it with hoes and ploughs. To you, the earth pays a bloody tribute. It bestowed gifts on us. You \n",
       "tear the earth's treasures from it by force. For us, the earth gave birth and blossomed because \n",

       "beyond the walls you've built to fence yourselves away in towns? Cohabit with your women \n",

       "you do differ somewhat?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I manage.' The witcher looked him straight in the eyes. 'I manage because I have to. Because \n",
       "I've no other way out. Because I've overcome the vanity and pride of being different. I've \n",
       "understood that they are a pitiful defence against being different. Because I've understood that \n",
       "the sun shines differently when something changes, but I'm not the axis of those changes. The \n",
       "sun shines differently, but it will continue to shine, and jumping at it with a hoe isn't going to \n",
       "do anything. We've got to accept facts, elf. That's what we've got to learn.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That's what you want, isn't it?' With his wrist Filavandrel \n",
       "\n",
       "wiped away the sweat above his white brows. 'Is that what you want to impose on others? The \n",
       "conviction that your time has come, your human era and age, and that what you're doing to \n",
       "other races is as natural as the rising and the setting of the sun? That everybody has to come to \n",
       "terms with it, to accept it? And you accuse me of vanity? And what are the views you're \n",
       "proclaiming? Why don't you humans finally realise that your domination of the world is as \n",
       "natural and repellant as lice multiplying in a sheepskin coat? You could propose we cohabit \n",
       "with lice and get the same reaction - and I'd listen to the lice as attentively if they, in return for \n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "conscious of your own powerlessness. Go on, thrust the sword into me. Revenge yourself on \n",
       "the whole human race. You'll see what relief that'll bring you. First kick me in the balls or the \n",

       "and no one can suspect who he's doing it for. We can't afford to go to war with you, and we \n",
       "won't be taken in by trade and exchange. We're not so naive that we don't know your \n",

       "After all, those stolen seeds aren't going to save you-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Nothing will save them anymore,' Geralt interrupted him. 'Don't grovel, Dandilion, don't beg \n",

       "which is supposed to turn your thoughts from imminent annihilation. Because you know this \n",
       "is the end. Nothing will sprout or yield crops on the plateaux, nothing will save you now. But \n",
       "you live long, and you will live very long in arrogant isolation, fewer and fewer of you, \n",
       "growing weaker and weaker, more and more bitter. And you know what'U happen then, \n",
       "Filavandrel. You know that desperate young men with the eyes of hundred-year-old men and \n",
       "withered, barren and sick girls like Toruviel will lead those who can still hold a sword and \n",
       "bow in their hands, down into the valleys. You'll come down into the blossoming valleys to \n",
       "meet death, wanting to die honourably, in battle, and not in sick beds of misery, where \n",
       "anaemia, tuberculosis and scurvy will send you. Then, long-living Aen Seidhe, you'll \n",

       "have a chance like that. You'll die shortly.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Spare him, at least,' Geralt indicated Dandilion with his head. 'No, not out of lofty mercy. Out \n",
       "of common sense. Nobody's going to ask after me, but they are going to take revenge for him.' \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "At his command the elves positioned themselves opposite Geralt and Dandilion with bows. \n",
       "They did it quickly; they'd obviously been waiting for this a long time. One of them, the \n",

       "ravishing. The Queen of the Fields, decorated with garlands of flowers, ears of corn, bunches \n",
       "of herbs. At her left-hand side a young stag pattered on stiff legs, at her right rustled an \n",
       "enormous hedgehog. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Dana Meadbh,' said Filavandrel with veneration. And then bowed and knelt. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The remaining elves also knelt; slowly, reluctantly, they fell to their knees one after the other \n",

       "crumpling the ornate reins of his white-maned mount in his hands. \n",
       "\n",
       "Dandilion walked up, pale and dumbfounded, supported by the sylvan. Lille looked at him \n",
       "and smiled. She looked into the witcher's eyes. She looked long. She didn't say a word. Words \n",
       "weren't necessary. \n",
       "\n",
       "Most of the elves were already in their saddles when Filavandrel and Toruviel approached. \n",

       "The elf nodded. From her saddle-bow, she took a lute, a \n",
       "\n",
       "marvellous instrument of light, tastefully inlaid wood with a slender, engraved neck. Without \n",
       "a word, she handed the lute to Dandilion. The poet accepted the instrument and smiled. Also \n",

       "\n",
       "'Farewell, strange human,' Filavandrel said quietly to Geralt. 'You're right. Words aren't \n",

       "cheek. 'This wood sings on its own! These strings are alive! What wonderful tonality! Bloody \n",
       "hell, a couple of kicks and a bit of fear is a pretty low price to pay for such a superb lute. I'd \n",
       "have let myself be kicked from dawn to dusk if I'd known what I was going to get. Geralt? \n",
       "Are you listening to me at all?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'It's difficult not to hear you two.' Geralt raised his head from the book and glanced at the \n",

       "\n",
       "'Duvvelsheyss, not neighbourhood,' Torque put his pipes aside. A desert, that's what it is. A \n",

       "\n",
       "'He misses his hemp,' laughed Dandilion, carefully turning the \n",
       "\n",
       "delicately engraved lute pegs. 'You should have sat in the thicket quiet as a dormouse instead \n",
       "of scaring girls, destroying dykes and sullying the well. I think you're going to be more \n",
       "careful now and give up your tricks, eh, Torque?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I like tricks,' declared the sylvan, baring his teeth. 'And I can't imagine life without them. But \n",
       "have it your way, I promise to be more careful on new territory. I'll be more restrained.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The night was cloudy and windy. The gale beat down the reeds and rustled in the branches of \n",
       "the bushes surrounding their camp. Dandilion threw some dry twigs into the fire. Torque \n",
       "wriggled around on his makeshift bed, swiping mosquitoes away with his tail. A fish leapt in \n",
       "the lake with a splash. \n",

       "too. Shouldn't we shelter under a roof like that?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'In principle, yes,' sighed the priestess. 'But . . ..' \n",

       "I \n",
       "\n",
       "The catfish stuck its barbelled head above the surface, tugged with force, splashed, stirred the \n",
       "water and flashed its white belly. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Careful, Dandilion!' shouted the witcher, digging his heels into the wet sand. 'Hold him, \n",
       "damn it!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I am holding him . . .' groaned the poet. 'Heavens, what a monster! It's a leviathan, not a fish! \n",
       "There'll be some good eating on that, dear gods!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Loosen it. Loosen it or the line will snap!' \n",
       "\n",
       "The catfish clung to the bed and threw itself against the current towards the bend in the river. \n",
       "The line hissed as Dandilion's and Geralt's gloves smouldered. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Pull, Geralt, pull! Don't loosen it or it'll get tangled up in the roots!' \n",

       "\n",
       "'No, it won't. Pull!' \n",
       "\n",
       "They hunched up and pulled. The line cut the water with a hiss, vibrated and scattered \n",
       "droplets which glistened like mercury in the rising sun. The catfish suddenly surfaced, set the \n",
       "water seething just below the surface, and the tension of the line eased. They quickly started \n",
       "to gather up the slack. \n",
       "\n",
       "'We'll smoke it,' panted Dandilion. 'We'll take it to the village and get it smoked. And we'll \n",

       "'Careful!' \n",
       "\n",
       "Feeling the shallows under its belly, the catfish threw half of its twelve-foot-long body out of \n",
       "the water, tossed its head, whacked its flat tail and took a sharp dive into the depths. Their \n",
       "gloves smouldered anew. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Pull, pull! To the bank, the son-of-a-bitch!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'The line is creaking! Loosen it, Dandilion!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'It'll hold, don't worry! We'll cook the head ... for soup . . .' \n",
       "\n",
       "The catfish, dragged near to the bank again, surged and strained furiously against them as if to \n",
       "let them know he wasn't that easy to get into the pot. The spray flew six feet into the air. \n",
       "\n",
       "'We'll sell the skin ...\" Dandilion, red with effort, pulled the line with both hands. 'And the \n",
       "barbels . . . We'll use the barbels to make-' \n",
       "\n",
       "Nobody ever found out what the poet was going to make from the catfish's barbels. The line \n",
       "snapped with a crack and both fishermen, losing their balance, fell onto the wet sand. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Bloody hell!' Dandilion yelled so loud that the echo resounded though the osiers. 'So much \n",
       "grub escaped! I hope you die, you son-of-a-catfish.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I told you,' Geralt shook his wet trousers. 'I told you not to use force when you pull. You \n",

       "\n",
       "'Oh really? You didn't lift a finger to help me set the line. You played the lute and hollered so \n",
       "the whole neighbourhood could hear you, nothing more.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You're wrong,' Dandilion bared his teeth. 'When you fell asleep, you see, I took the grubs off \n",
       "the hook and attached a dead crow, which I'd found in the bushes. I wanted to see your face in \n",
       "the morning when you pulled the crow out. And the catfish took the crow. Your grubs would \n",
       "have caught shit-all.' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'They would have, they would have.' The witcher spat into the water, winding the line on to a \n",
       "little wooden rake. 'But it snapped because you tugged like an idiot. Wind up the rest of the \n",
       "lines instead of gabbling. The sun's already up, it's time to go. I'm going to pack up.' \n",

       "only got caught. Hell, it's holding like a stone, I can't do it! Ah, that's it . . . Ha, ha, look what \n",
       "I'm bringing in. It must be the wreck of a barge from King Dezmod's time! What great stuff! \n",
       "Look, Geralt!' \n",
       "\n",
       "Dandilion was clearly exaggerating; the clump of rotted ropes, net and algae pulled out of the \n",
       "water was impressive but it was far from being the size of a barge dating from the days of the \n",
       "legendary king. The bard scattered the jumble over the bank and began to dig around in it \n",
       "with the tip of his shoe. The algae was alive with leeches, scuds and little crabs. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Ha! Look what I've found!' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt approached, curious. The find was a chipped stoneware jar, something like a two-\n",
       "handled amphora, tangled up in netting, black with rotten algae, colonies of caddis-larvae and \n",
       "snails, dripping with stinking slime. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Ha!' Dandilion exclaimed again, proudly. 'Do you know what this is?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'It's an old pot.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You're wrong,' declared the troubadour, scraping away shells and hardened, shiny clay. 'This \n",
       "is a charmed jar. There's a djinn inside who'll fulfil my three wishes.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher snorted. \n",
       "\n",
       "'You can laugh,' Dandilion finished his scraping, bent over and rinsed the amphora. 'But \n",
       "there's a seal on the spigot and a wizard's mark on the seal.'' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What mark? Let's see.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Oh, sure.' The poet hid the jar behind his back. 'And what more do you want? I'm the one \n",
       "who found it and I need all the wishes.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Don't touch that seal! Leave it alone!' \n",

       "\n",
       "'Sure!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Don't touch it! Oh, bloody hell!' \n",
       "\n",
       "The jar fell to the sand during their scuffle, and luminous red smoke burst forth. \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher jumped back and rushed towards the camp for his sword. Dandilion, folding his \n",
       "arms across his chest, didn't move. \n",
       "\n",
       "The smoke pulsated and collected in an irregular sphere level with Dandilion's eyes. The \n",
       "sphere formed a six-foot-wide distorted head with no nose, enormous eyes and a sort of beak. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Djinn!' said Dandilion, stamping his foot. 'I freed thee and as of this day, I am thy lord. My \n",
       "wishes-' \n",
       "\n",
       "The head snapped its beak, which wasn't really a beak but something in the shape of drooping, \n",
       "deformed and ever-changing lips. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Run!' yelled the witcher. 'Run, Dandilion!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'My wishes,' continued the poet, 'are as follows. Firstly, may Valdo Marx, the troubadour of \n",
       "Cidaris, die of apoplexy as soon as possible. Secondly, there's a count's daughter in Caelf \n",
       "called Virginia who refuses all advances. May she succumb to mine. Thirdly-' \n",
       "\n",
       "No one ever found out Dandilion's third wish. \n",
       "\n",
       "Two monstrous paws emerged from the horrible head and grabbed the bard by the throat. \n",
       "Dandilion screeched. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt reached the head in three leaps, swiped his silver sword and slashed it through the \n",
       "middle. The air howled, the head exhaled smoke and rapidly doubled in diameter. The \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "monstrous jaw, now also much larger, flew open, snapped and whistled; the paws pulled the \n",
       "struggling Dandilion around and crushed him to the ground. \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher crossed his fingers in the Sign of Aard and threw as much energy as he could \n",
       "muster at the head. The energy materialised in a blinding beam, sliced through the glow \n",
       "surrounding the head and hit its mark. The boom was so loud that it stabbed Geralt's ears, and \n",
       "the air sucked in by the implosion made the willows rustle. The roar of the monster was \n",
       "deafening as it grew even larger, but it released the poet, soared up, circled and, waving its \n",
       "paws, flew away over the water. \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher rushed to pull Dandilion - who was lying motionless - away. At that moment, his \n",
       "fingers touched a round object buried in the sand. \n",
       "\n",
       "It was a brass seal decorated with the sign of a broken cross and a nine-pointed star. \n",
       "\n",
       "The head, suspended above the river, had become the size of a haystack, while the open, \n",
       "roaring jaws looked like the gates of an average-sized barn. Stretching out its paws, the \n",
       "monster attacked. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt, not having the least idea of what to do, squeezed the seal in his fist and, extending his \n",
       "hand towards the assailant, screamed out the words of an exorcism a priestess had once taught \n",
       "him. He had never used those words until now because, in principle, he didn't believe in \n",
       "superstitions. \n",
       "\n",
       "The effect surpassed his expectations. \n",
       "\n",
       "The seal hissed and grew hot, burning his hand. The gigantic head froze in the air, suspended, \n",
       "motionless above the river. It hung like that for a moment then, at last, it began to howl, roar, \n",
       "and dispersed into a pulsating bundle of smoke, into a huge, whirling cloud. The cloud \n",
       "whined shrilly and whisked upstream with incredible speed, leaving a trail of churned-up \n",
       "water on the surface. In a matter of seconds, it had disappeared into the distance; only a \n",
       "dwindling howl lingered across the water. \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher rushed to the poet, cowering on the sand. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Dandilion? Are you dead? Dandilion, damn it! What's the matter with you?' \n",
       "\n",
       "The poet jerked his head, shook his hands and opened his mouth to scream. Geralt grimaced \n",
       "and narrowed his eyes - Dandilion had a trained - loud - tenor voice and, when frightened, \n",
       "could reach extraordinary registers. But what emerged from the bard's throat was a barely \n",
       "audible, hoarse croak. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Dandilion! What's the matter with you? Answer me!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Hhhh . . . eeee . . . kheeeee . . . theeee whhhhorrrrrrre . . .' \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "'Hhhh . . . Whhhooo ...\" \n",
       "\n",
       "'Don't say anything. If everything's all right, nod.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Dandilion grimaced and, with great difficulty, nodded and then immediately turned on his \n",
       "side, curled up and - choking and coughing - vomited blood. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt cursed. \n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "II \n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "'By all the gods!' The guard stepped back and lowered the lantern. 'What's the matter with \n",
       "him?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Let us through, my good man,' said the witcher quietly, supporting Dandilion, who was \n",
       "huddled up in the saddle. 'We're in great haste, as you see.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I do.' The guard swallowed, looking at the poet's pale face and chin covered in black, dried \n",
       "blood. 'Wounded? It looks terrible, sir.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I'm in haste,' repeated Geralt. 'We've been travelling since dawn. Let us through, please.' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'We can't,' said the other guard. 'You're only allowed through between sunrise and sunset. \n",
       "None may pass at night. That's the order. There's no way through for anyone unless they've \n",
       "got a letter of safe-conduct from the king or the mayor. Or they're nobility with a coat of \n",
       "arms.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Dandilion croaked, huddled up even more, resting his forehead on the horse's mane, \n",
       "shuddered, shook and retched dryly. Another stream of blood trickled down the branched, \n",
       "dried pattern on his mount's neck. \n",
       "\n",
       "'My good men,' Geralt said as calmly as he could, 'you can see for yourselves how badly he \n",
       "fares. I have to find someone who can treat him. Let us through. Please.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Don't ask.' The guard leant on his halberd. 'Orders are orders. I'll go to the pillory if I let you \n",
       "through. They'll chase me from service, and then how will I feed my children? No, sir, I can't. \n",
       "Take your friend down from the horse and put him in the room in the barbican. We'll dress \n",
       "him and he'll last out until dawn, if that's his fate. It's not long now,' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A dressing's not enough.' The witcher ground his teeth. 'We need a healer, a priest, a gifted \n",
       "doctor-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You wouldn't be waking up anyone like that at night anyway,' said the second guard. 'The \n",
       "most we can do is see that you don't have to camp out under the gate until dawn. It's warm in \n",
       "there and there's somewhere to put your friend; he'll fare better there than in the saddle. Come \n",
       "on, let us help you lower him from the horse.' \n",
       "\n",
       "It was warm, stuffy and cosy in the room within the barbican. A fire crackled merrily in the \n",
       "hearth, and behind it a cricket chirped fiercely. \n",
       "\n",
       "Three men sat at the heavy square table laid with jugs and plates. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Forgive us for disturbing you, squires ...' said the guard, holding Dandilion up. 'I trust you \n",
       "won't mind . . . This one here is a knight, hmm . .. And the other one is wounded, so I \n",
       "thought-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You thought well,' one of the men turned his slender, sharp, expressive face towards them \n",
       "and got up. 'Here, lay him down on the pallet.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The man was an elf, like the other one sitting at the table. Both, judging by their clothes, \n",
       "which were a typical mixture of human and elven fashion, were elves who had settled and \n",
       "integrated. The third man, who looked the eldest, was human, a knight, judging by the way he \n",
       "was dressed and by his salt-and-pepper hair, cut to fit beneath a helmet. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I'm Chireadan,' the taller of the elves, with an expressive face, introduced himself. As was \n",
       "usual with representatives of the Old People, it was difficult to guess his age; he could have \n",
       "been twenty or one hundred and twenty. 'This is my cousin Errdil. And this nobleman is the \n",
       "knight Vratimir.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A nobleman,' muttered Geralt, but a closer look at the coat of arms embroidered on his tunic \n",
       "shattered his hopes: a shield divided per cross and bearing golden lilies was cut diagonally by \n",
       "a silver bar. Vratimir was not only illegitimate but came from a mixed, human-nonhuman \n",
       "union. As a result, although he was entitled to use a coat of arms, he couldn't consider himself \n",
       "a true nobleman, and the privilege of crossing the city gate after dusk most certainly wasn't \n",
       "extended to him. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Unfortunately,' - the witcher's scrutiny did not escape the elf's attention - 'we, too, have to \n",
       "remain here until dawn. The law knows no exceptions, at least not for the likes of us. We \n",
       "invite you to join our company, sir knight.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Geralt, of Rivia,' the witcher introduced himself. 'A witcher, not a knight.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What's the matter with him?' Chireadan indicated Dandilion, whom the guards had laid on a \n",
       "pallet in the meantime. 'It looks like poisoning. If it is poisoning, then I can help. I've got \n",
       "some good medicine with me.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt sat down, then quickly gave a guarded account of events at the river. The elves looked \n",
       "at each other, and the knight spat through his teeth and frowned. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'Extraordinary,' Chireadan remarked. 'What could it have been?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A djinn in a bottle,' muttered Vratimir. 'Like a fairy tale-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Not quite.' Geralt indicated Dandilion, curled up on the pallet. 'I don't know of any fairy tale \n",
       "that ends like this.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That poor fellow's injuries,' said Chireadan, 'are evidently of a magical nature. I fear that my \n",
       "medicine will not be of much use. But I can at least lessen his suffering. Have you already \n",
       "given him a remedy, Geralt?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A painkilling elixir.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Come and help me. You can hold his head up.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Dandilion greedily drank the medicine, diluted with wine, choked on his last sip, wheezed and \n",
       "covered the leather pillow with spittle. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I know him,' Errdil said. 'He's Dandilion, the troubadour and poet. I saw him singing at the \n",
       "court of King Ethain in Cidaris once.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A troubadour,' repeated Chireadan, looking at Geralt. 'That's bad. Very bad. The muscles of \n",
       "his neck and throat are attacked. Changes in his vocal cords are starting to take place. The \n",
       "spell's action has to be halted as soon as possible otherwise . . . This might be irreversible.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That means . . . Does that mean he won't be able to talk?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Talk, yes. Maybe. Not sing.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt sat down at the table without saying a word and rested his forehead on his clenched \n",
       "fists. \n",
       "\n",
       "'A wizard,' said Vratimir. 'A magical remedy or a curative spell is needed. You have to take \n",
       "him to some other town, witcher.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What?' Geralt raised his head. 'And here, in Rinde? Isn't there a wizard here?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Magicians are hard to come by in the whole of Redania,' said the knight. 'Isn't that true? Ever \n",
       "since King Heribert placed an exorbitant tax on spells, magicians have boycotted the capital \n",
       "and those towns which are rigorous in executing the king's edicts. And the councillors of \n",
       "Rinde are famous for their zeal in this respect. Chireadan, Errdil, am I right?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You are,' confirmed Errdil. 'But . . . Chireadan, may I?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You have to,' said Chireadan, looking at the witcher. 'There's no point in making a secret of \n",
       "it; everyone knows anyway. There's a sorceress staying in the town right now, Geralt.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Incognito, no doubt?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Not very,' smiled the elf. 'The sorceress in question is something of an individualist. She's \n",
       "ignoring both the boycott imposed on Rinde by the Council of Wizards, and the disposition of \n",
       "the local councillors, and is doing rather splendidly out of it: the boycott means there's \n",
       "tremendous demand for magical services here and, of course, the sorceress isn't paying any \n",
       "levies.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And the town council puts up with it?' \n",

       "with a kick in the knee, shoved him with his shoulder and fetched him another \n",
       "\n",
       "blow with the purse. The doorman's eyes grew hazy and diverged in a comical squint, and his \n",

       "\n",
       "The room was a big kitchen, full of utensils, smelling of herbs and resinous wood. On the \n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt shrugged, then nodded sympathetically. He generally avoided overdoing the alcohol \n",
       "but the state in which the merchant \n",
       "\n",
       "found himself was not entirely unknown to him. He found a jug and a tin mug among the \n",
       "crockery and drew some juice from the barrel. He heard snoring and turned. Beau Berrant was \n",
       "fast asleep, his head hanging on his chest. \n",
       "\n",
       "For a moment, the witcher considered pouring juice over him to wake him up, but he changed \n",
       "his mind. He left the kitchen, carrying the jug. The corridor ended in a heavy inlaid door. He \n",
       "entered carefully, opening it just enough to slip inside. It was dark, so he dilated his pupils. \n",
       "And wrinkled his nose. \n",
       "\n",
       "A heavy smell of sour wine, candles and overripe fruit hung in the air. And something else, \n",
       "that brought to mind a mixture of the scents of lilac and gooseberries. \n",
       "\n",
       "He looked around. The table in the middle of the chamber bore a battlefield of jugs, carafes, \n",
       "goblets, silver plates, dishes and ivory-handled cutlery. A creased tablecloth, which had been \n",
       "pushed aside, was soaked in wine, covered in purple stains and stiff with wax which had \n",
       "trickled down the candlesticks. Orange peel glowed like flowers among plum and peach \n",
       "stones, pear cores and grape stalks. A goblet had fallen over and smashed. The other was in \n",
       "one piece, half full, with a turkey bone sticking out of it. Next to the goblet stood a black, \n",
       "high-heeled slipper. It was made of basilisk skin. There wasn't a more expensive raw material \n",
       "which could be used in the making of shoes. \n",
       "\n",
       "The other slipper lay under a chair on top of a carelessly discarded black dress with white \n",
       "frills and an embroidered flowery pattern. \n",
       "\n",
       "For a moment Geralt stood undecided, struggling with embarrassment and the desire to turn \n",
       "on his heel and leave. But that would have meant his tussle with the Cerberus below had been \n",
       "unnecessary. And the witcher didn't like doing anything unnecessarily. He noticed winding \n",
       "stairs in the corner of the chamber. \n",
       "\n",
       "On the steps he found four withered white roses and a napkin stained with wine and crimson \n",
       "lipstick. The scent of lilac and gooseberries grew stronger. The stairs led to a bedroom, the \n",
       "floor of which was covered in an enormous, shaggy animal skin. A \n",
       "\n",
       "white shirt with lace cuffs, and umpteen white roses, lay on the skin. And a black stocking. \n",
       "\n",
       "The other stocking hung from one of the four engraved posts which supported the domed \n",
       "canopy over the bed. The engravings on the posts depicted nymphs and fauns in various \n",
       "positions. Some of the positions were interesting. Others funny. Many repeated themselves. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt cleared his throat loudly, looking at the abundant black locks visible from under the \n",
       "eiderdown. The eiderdown moved and moaned. Geralt cleared his throat even louder. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Beau?' the abundance of black locks asked indistinctly. 'Have you brought the juice?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Yes.' \n",
       "\n",
       "A pale triangular face, violet eyes and narrow, slightly contorted lips appeared beneath the \n",
       "black tresses. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Ooooh . . .' The lips became even more contorted. 'Ooooh . . . I'm dying of thirst . . .' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Here you are.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The woman sat up, scrambling out of the bedclothes. She had pretty shoulders, a shapely neck \n",
       "and, around it, a black velvet choker with a star-shaped jewel sparkling with diamonds. Apart \n",
       "from the choker she had nothing on. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Thank you.' She took the mug from his hand, drank greedily, then raised her arms and \n",
       "touched her temples. The eiderdown slipped down even further. Geralt averted his eyes - \n",
       "politely, but unwillingly. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Who are you?' asked the black-haired woman, narrowing her eyes and covering herself with \n",
       "the eiderdown. 'What are you doing here? And where, dammit, is Berrant?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Which question shall I answer first?' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "He immediately regretted his sarcasm. The woman raised her hand and a golden streak shot \n",
       "out from her fingers. Geralt reacted instinctively, crossing both hands in the Sign of \n",
       "Heliotrope, and caught the spell just in front of his face, but the discharge was so strong that it \n",
       "threw him back against the wall. He sank to the floor. \n",
       "\n",
       "'No need!' he shouted, seeing the woman raise her hand again. 'Lady Yennefer! I come in \n",
       "peace, with no evil intentions!' \n",
       "\n",
       "A stamping came from the stairs and servants loomed in the bedroom doorway. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Lady Yennefer!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Leave,' the sorceress ordered calmly. 'I don't need you. You're paid to keep an eye on the \n",
       "house. But since this individual has, nevertheless, managed to get in, I'll take care of him \n",
       "myself. Pass that on to Berrant. And prepare a bath for me.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher got up with difficulty. Yennefer observed him in silence, narrowing her eyes. \n",
       "\n",
       "'You parried my spell,' she finally said. 'You're not a sorcerer, that's obvious. But you reacted \n",
       "exceptionally fast. Tell me who you are, stranger who has come in peace. And I advise you to \n",
       "speak quickly.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I'm Geralt of Rivia. A witcher.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Yennefer leant out of the bed, grasping a faun - engraved on the pole - by a piece of anatomy \n",
       "well adapted to being grasped. Without taking her eyes off Geralt, she picked a coat with a fur \n",
       "collar up off the floor and wrapped herself up in it tightly before getting up. She poured \n",
       "herself another mug of juice without hurrying, drank it in one go, coughed and came closer. \n",
       "Geralt discreetly rubbed his lower back which, a moment ago, had collided painfully with the \n",
       "wall. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Geralt of Rivia,' repeated the sorceress, looking at him from behind black lashes. 'How did \n",
       "you get in here? And for what reason? You didn't hurt Berrant, I hope?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'No. I didn't. Lady Yennefer, I need your help.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A witcher,' she muttered, coming up even closer and wrapping the coat around her more \n",
       "tightly. 'Not only is it the first one I've seen up close but it's none other than the famous White \n",
       "Wolf. I've heard about you.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I can imagine.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I don't know what you can imagine.' She yawned, then came even closer. 'May I?' She \n",
       "touched his cheek and looked him in the eyes. He clenched his jaw. 'Do your pupils \n",
       "automatically adapt to \n",
       "\n",
       "light or can you narrow and dilate them according to your will?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Yennefer,' he said calmly, 'I rode nonstop all day from Rinde. I waited all night for the gates \n",
       "to open. I gave your doorman, who didn't want to let me in, a blow to the head. I disturbed \n",
       "your sleep and peace, discourteously and importunately. All because my friend needs help \n",
       "which only you can give him. Give it to him, please, and then, if you like, we can talk about \n",
       "mutations and aberrations.' \n",
       "\n",
       "She took a step back and contorted her lips unpleasantly. 'What sort of help do you mean?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'The regeneration of organs injured through magic. The throat, larynx and vocal cords. An \n",
       "injury caused by a scarlet mist. Or something very much like it.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Very much like it,' she repeated. 'To put it in a nutshell, it wasn't a scarlet mist which has \n",
       "injured your friend. So what was it? Speak out. Being torn from my sleep at dawn, I have \n",
       "neither the strength nor the desire to probe your brain.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Hmm ... It's best I start from the beginning.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Oh, no,' she interrupted him. 'If it's all that complicated then wait. An aftertaste in my mouth, \n",
       "dishevelled hair, sticky eyes and other morning inconveniences strongly affect my perceptive \n",
       "faculties. Go downstairs to the bath-chamber in the cellar. I'll be there in a minute and then \n",

       "before the chime of midday. I'm prepared to do without breakfast. Do you know why? \n",
       "Because you brought me the apple juice. You were in a hurry, your head was troubled with \n",
       "your friend's suffering, you forced your way in here, and yet you thought of a thirsty woman. \n",
       "You won me over, so my help is not out of the question. But I won't do anything without hot \n",

       "\n",
       "'Don't be embarrassed,' she said, throwing an armful of clothing on the hook. 'I don't faint at \n",

       "all.' \n",
       "\n",
       "He got up, wrapping a towel round his hips. \n",
       "\n",

       "a saw-mill?' \n",

       "'The first witcher I can look at from close up, and completely naked at that. Aha!' She leant \n",
       "over, listening. 'I can hear your heart beat. It's very slow. Can you control how much adrenalin \n",
       "you secrete? Oh, forgive me my professional curiosity. Apparently, you're touchy about the \n",
       "qualities of your own body. You're wont to describe these qualities using words which I \n",
       "greatly dislike, lapsing into pompous sarcasm with it, something I dislike even more.' \n",
       "\n",
       "He didn't answer. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Well, enough of that. My bath is getting cold.' Yennefer moved as if she wanted to discard \n",
       "her coat, then hesitated. 'I'll take my bath while you talk, to save time. But I don't want to \n",
       "embarrass you and, besides, we hardly know each other. So then, taking decency into \n",

       "'No. I have to see the eyes of the person I'm talking to. I've got a better idea.' \n",
       "\n",
       "He heard an incantation being recited, felt his medallion quiver and saw the black coat softly \n",
       "slip to the floor. Then he heard the water splashing. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Now I can't see your eyes, Yennefer,' he said. 'And that's a pity.' \n",

       "\n",
       "Geralt finished struggling with his trousers, pulling them on under his towel, and sat on the \n",
       "bench. Buckling up his boots, he related the adventure by the river, cutting out most of the \n",
       "skirmish with the catfish. Yennefer didn't seem the type to be interested in fishing. \n",
       "\n",
       "When he got to the part where the cloud-creature escaped from the jar, the huge soapy sponge \n",
       "froze. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Well, well,' he heard, 'that's interesting. A djinn in a bottle.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'No djinn,' he contested. 'It was some variant of scarlet mist. Some new, unknown type-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'The new and unknown type deserves to be called something,' said the invisible Yennefer. \n",
       "'The name djinn is no worse than any other. Continue, please.' \n",
       "\n",
       "He obeyed. The soap in the tub foamed relentlessly as he continued his tale, and the water \n",
       "overflowed. Something caught his eye. Looking more carefully he discerned outlines and \n",
       "shapes revealed by the soap covering the invisible Yennefer. They fascinated him to the \n",
       "extent that he was struck dumb. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'Go on!' a voice coming from nothingness, from above the outlines which so absorbed him, \n",

       "'That's all,' he said. 'I chased him away, that djinn, as you call him-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'How?' The ladle rose and poured water. The soap vanished, as did the shapes. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt sighed. 'With an incantation,' he said. An exorcism.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Which one?' The ladle poured water once more. The witcher started to observe the ladle's \n",
       "action more diligently because the water, albeit briefly, also revealed this and that. He \n",
       "repeated the incantation, substituting the vowel 'e' with an intake of breath, \n",
       "\n",
       "according to the safety rule. He thought he'd impress the sorceress by knowing the rule so he \n",
       "was surprised when he heard laughter coming from the tub. \n",
       "\n",
       "'What's so funny?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That exorcism of yours . . .' The towel flew off its peg and suddenly began to wipe the rest of \n",

       "\n",
       "'A priestess from Huldra's sanctuary. It's a secret language of the temple-' \n",

       "and wet footprints marked the sorceress's steps. 'That wasn't an incantation, Geralt. Nor would \n",
       "I advise you to repeat those words in other temples.' \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "The cork sprang from a rectangular crystal bottle standing on the stool. The bath-chamber \n",
       "started to smell of lilac and gooseberries. The cork traced several circles and jumped back into \n",
       "place. The sorceress fastened the cuffs of her shirt, pulled on a dress and materialised. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Fasten me up.' She turned her back to him while combing her hair with a tortoiseshell comb. \n",
       "He noticed that the comb had a long, sharp prong which could, if need be, easily take the \n",
       "place of a dagger. \n",
       "\n",
       "He took a deliberately long time fastening her dress, one hook at a time, enjoying the scent of \n",
       "her hair, which fell halfway down her back in a black cascade. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Going back to the bottle creature,' said Yennefer, putting diamond earrings in her ears, 'it's \n",
       "obvious that it wasn't your funny incantation that drove him away. The hypothesis that he \n",
       "discharged his fury on your friend and left seems closer to the truth.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Probably,' Geralt agreed, gloomily. 'I don't think he flew off to Cidaris to do away with Valdo \n",
       "Marx.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Who's Valdo Marx?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A troubadour who considers my companion, also a poet and musician, a talentless wastrel \n",
       "who panders to the taste of the masses.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The sorceress turned round with a strange glimmer in her eyes. 'Could it be that your friend \n",
       "managed to express a wish?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Two. Both stupid. Why do you ask? This fulfilling of wishes by genies is nonsense, after all, \n",
       "djinns, spirits of the lamp-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Clearly nonsense,' repeated Yennefer with a smile. 'Of course. It's an invention, a fairy tale \n",
       "devoid of any sense, like all the legends in which good spirits and fortune tellers fulfil wishes. \n",
       "Stories like that are made up by poor simpletons, who can't even dream of fulfilling their \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "wishes and desires themselves. I'm pleased you're not one of them, Geralt of Rivia. It makes \n",
       "you closer in spirit to me. If I want something, I don't dream of it - I act. And I always get \n",
       "what I want.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I don't doubt it. Are you ready?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I am.' The sorceress finished fastening the straps of her slippers and stood up. Even in high \n",
       "heels, she wasn't impressively tall. She shook her hair which, he found, had retained its \n",
       "picturesque, dishevelled and curling disarray despite the furious combing. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I've got a question, Geralt. The seal which closed the bottle . . . Has your friend still got it?' \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher reflected. He had the seal, not Dandilion. But experience had taught him that \n",
       "sorcerers shouldn't be told too much. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Hmm ... I think so.' He deceived her as to the reason for his delay in replying. 'Yes, he \n",
       "probably does. Why? Is the seal important?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That's a strange question,' she said sharply, 'for a witcher and a specialist in supernatural \n",
       "monstrosities. Someone who ought to know that such a seal is important enough not to touch. \n",
       "And not to let their friend touch.' \n",
       "\n",
       "He clenched his jaw. The blow was well aimed. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Oh, well.' Yennefer changed her tone to a much gentler one. 'No one's infallible and no \n",
       "witcher's infallible, as we see. Everyone can make a mistake. Well, we can get it on our way. \n",
       "Where's your comrade?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Here, in Rinde. At Errdil's. The elf's.' \n",
       "\n",
       "She looked at him carefully. \n",
       "\n",
       "'At Errdil's?' she repeated, contorting her lips in a smile. 'I know where that is. And I gather \n",
       "his cousin Chireadan is there too?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That's right. But what-?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Nothing,' she interrupted, raised her arms and closed her eyes. \n",
       "\n",
       "The medallion around the witcher's neck pulsed, tugged at the chain. \n",
       "\n",
       "On the damp bath-chamber wall shone the luminous outline of a door which framed a swirling \n",
       "phosphorescent milky nothingness. The witcher cursed. He didn't like magical portals, or \n",
       "travelling by them. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Do we have to . . .' He cleared his throat. 'It's not far-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I can't walk the streets of this town,' she cut him short. 'They're not too crazy about me here. \n",
       "They might insult me and throw stones - or do something worse. Several people are \n",
       "effectively ruining my reputation here, thinking they can get away with it. Don't worry, my \n",
       "portals are safe.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt had once watched as only half a traveller using a safe portal flew through. The other \n",
       "half was never found. He knew of several cases where people had entered a portal and never \n",
       "been seen again. \n",
       "\n",
       "The sorceress adjusted her hair again and pinned a pearl-embossed purse to her belt. The \n",
       "purse looked too small to hold anything other than a handful of coppers and a lipstick, but \n",
       "Geralt knew it was no ordinary purse. \n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "'Hold me. Tighter. I'm not made of china. On our way!' The medallion vibrated, something \n",
       "flashed and Geralt suddenly found himself in black nothingness, in penetrating cold. He \n",
       "couldn't see, hear or feel anything. Cold was all that his senses could register. \n",
       "\n",
       "He wanted to curse, but didn't have time. \n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "V \n",
       "\n",
       " \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'It's an hour since she went in,' Chireadan turned over the hourglass standing on the table. 'I'm \n",
       "starting to get worried. Was Dandilion's throat really so bad? Don't you think we ought to go \n",
       "and have a look?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'She made it quite clear that she didn't want us to.' Geralt finished his mug of herb tea, \n",
       "grimacing dreadfully. He valued and liked the settled elves for their intelligence, calm reserve \n",
       "and sense of humour, but he couldn't understand or share their taste in food or drink. 'I don't \n",
       "intend to disturb her, Chireadan. Magic requires time. It can take all day and night, as long as \n",
       "Dandilion gets better.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Oh well, you're right.' \n",
       "\n",
       "A sound of hammering came from the room next door. Errdil, as it turned out, lived in a \n",
       "deserted inn which he had bought intending to renovate and then open with his wife, a quiet, \n",
       "taciturn elf. Vratimir, who had taken to their company after a night spent with the elves in the \n",
       "guardroom, volunteered to help with the repairs. He got down to renovating the wood \n",
       "panelling, working alongside the married couple, as soon as the confusion created by the \n",
       "witcher and Yennefer leaping through the wall in the flash of a portal had subsided. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I didn't think you'd find it so easy, if I'm to be honest,' Chireadan went on. 'Yennefer isn't the \n",
       "most spontaneous of people when it comes to help. Others' troubles don't particularly bother \n",
       "her, and don't disturb her sleep. In a word, I've never heard of \n",
       "\n",
       "her helping anyone if there wasn't something in it for her. I wonder what's in it for her to help \n",
       "you and Dandilion.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Aren't you exaggerating?' The witcher smiled. 'I didn't have such a bad impression of her. She \n",
       "likes to demonstrate her superiority, it's true, but compared with other wizards, with that \n",
       "whole arrogant bunch, she's walking charm and kindliness personified.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Chireadan also smiled. 'It's almost as though you thought a scorpion were prettier than a \n",
       "spider,' he said, 'because it's got such a lovely tail. Be careful, Geralt. You're not the first to \n",
       "have judged her like that without knowing she's turned her charm and beauty into weapons. \n",
       "Weapons she uses skilfully and without \n",
       "\n",
       "scruple. Which, of course, doesn't change the fact that she's a fascinating and good-looking \n",
       "woman. You wouldn't disagree, would you?' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt glanced keenly at the elf. For a second time, he thought he saw traces of a blush on his \n",
       "face. It surprised him no less than Chireadan's words. Pure-blooded elves were not wont to \n",
       "admire human women, even the very beautiful ones, and Yennefer, although attractive in her \n",
       "own way, couldn't pass as a great beauty. \n",
       "\n",
       "Each to their own taste but, in actual fact, not many would describe sorceresses as good-\n",
       "looking. Indeed, all of them came from social circles where the only fate for daughters would \n",
       "be marriage. Who would have thought of condemning their daughter to years of tedious \n",
       "studies and the tortures of somatic mutations if she could be given away in marriage and \n",
       "advantageously allied? Who wished to have a sorceress in their family? Despite the respect \n",
       "enjoyed by magicians, a sorceress's family did not benefit from her in the least because by the \n",
       "time the girl had completed her education, nothing tied her to her family anymore - only \n",
       "brotherhood counted, to the exclusion of all else. So only daughters with no chance of finding \n",
       "a husband become sorceresses. \n",
       "\n",
       "Unlike priestesses and druidesses, who only unwillingly took ugly or crippled girls, sorcerers \n",
       "took anyone who showed evidence of a predisposition. If the child passed the first years of \n",
       "training, magic entered into the equation - straightening and evening out legs, repairing \n",
       "bones which had badly knitted, patching hare-lips, \n",
       "\n",
       "removing scars, birthmarks and pox scars. The young sorceress would become attractive \n",
       "because the prestige of her profession demanded it. The result was pseudo-pretty women with \n",
       "the angry and cold eyes of ugly girls. Girls who couldn't forget their ugliness had been \n",
       "covered by the mask of magic only for the prestige of their profession. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "No, Geralt couldn't understand Chireadan. His eyes, the eyes of a witcher, registered too many \n",
       "details. \n",
       "\n",
       "'No, Chireadan,' he answered. 'I wouldn't disagree. Thank you for the warning. But this only \n",
       "concerns Dandiliori. He suffered at my side, in my presence. I didn't manage to save him and \n",
       "I couldn't help him. I'd sit on a scorpion with my bare backside if I knew it would help him.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That's precisely what you've got to beware of most.' The elf smiled enigmatically. 'Because \n",
       "Yennefer knows it and she likes to make the most of such knowledge. Don't trust her, Geralt. \n",
       "She's dangerous.' \n",
       "\n",
       "He didn't answer. \n",
       "\n",
       "Upstairs, the door squeaked. Yennefer stood at the stairs, leaning on the gallery balustrade. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Witcher, could you come here?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Of course.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The sorceress leant her back against the door of one of the few rooms with furniture, where \n",
       "they had put the suffering troubadour. \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher approached, watchful and silent. He saw her left shoulder, slightly higher than \n",
       "her right. Her nose, slightly too long. Her lips, a touch too narrow. Her chin, receding a little \n",
       "too much. Her brows a little too irregular. Her eyes . . . \n",
       "\n",
       "He saw too many details. Quite unnecessarily. \n",
       "\n",
       "'How's Dandilion?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Do you doubt my capabilities?' \n",
       "\n",
       "He continued watching. She had the figure of a twenty-year-old, although he preferred not to \n",
       "guess at her real age. She moved with natural, unaffected grace. No, there was no way of \n",
       "guessing what she had been like before, what had been improved. He stopped thinking about \n",
       "it; there wasn't any sense. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Your talented friend will be well,' she said. 'He'll recover his vocal talents.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You have my gratitude, Yennefer.' \n",
       "\n",
       "She smiled. You'll have an opportunity to prove it.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Can I look in on him?' \n",
       "\n",
       "She remained silent for a moment, watching him with a strange smile and drumming her \n",
       "fingers on the door-frame. 'Of course. Go in.' \n",
       "\n",
       "The medallion on the witcher's neck started to quiver, sharply and rhythmically. \n",
       "\n",
       "A glass sphere the size of a small watermelon, aflame with a milky light, lay in the centre of \n",
       "the floor. The sphere marked the heart of a precisely traced nine-pointed star whose arms \n",
       "reached the corners and walls of the small chamber. A red pentagram was inscribed within the \n",
       "star. The tips of the pentagram were marked by black candles standing in weirdly shaped \n",
       "holders. Black candles had also been lit at the head of the bed where Dandilion, covered with \n",
       "sheepskins, rested. The poet was breathing peacefully; he didn't wheeze or rasp anymore and \n",
       "the rictus of pain had disappeared from his face, to be replaced by an idiotic smile of \n",
       "happiness. \n",
       "\n",
       "'He's asleep,' said Yennefer. And dreaming.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt examined the patterns traced on the floor. The magic hidden within them was palpable, \n",
       "but he knew it was a dormant magic. It brought to mind the purr of a sleeping lion, without \n",
       "suggesting how the roar might sound. \n",
       "\n",
       "'What is this, Yennefer?' \n",
       "\n",
       "A trap.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'For what?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'For you, for the time being.' The sorceress turned the key in the lock, then turned it over in \n",
       "her hand. The key disappeared. \n",
       "\n",
       "And thus I'm trapped,' he said coldly. 'What now? Are you going to assault my virtue?' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'Don't flatter yourself.' Yennefer sat on the edge of the bed. Dandilion, still smiling like a \n",
       "moron, groaned quietly. It was, without a doubt, a groan of bliss. \n",
       "\n",
       "'What's this all about, Yennefer? If it's a game, I don't know the rules.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I told you,' she began, 'that I always get what I want. As it happens, I desire something that \n",
       "Dandilion has. I'll get it from him and we can part ways. Don't worry, he won't come to any \n",
       "harm-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'The things you've set on the floor,' he interrupted, 'are used to summon demons. Someone \n",
       "always comes to harm where demons are summoned. I won't allow it.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'-not a hair of his head will be harmed,' continued the sorceress, without paying any \n",
       "attention to his words. 'His voice will be even more beautiful and he'll be very pleased, even \n",
       "happy. We'll all be happy. And we'll part with no ill-feelings or resentment.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Oh, Virginia,' moaned Dandilion without opening his eyes. 'Your breasts are so beautiful, \n",
       "more delicate than a swan's down . . . Virginia . . .' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Has he lost his mind? Is he raving?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'He's dreaming,' smiled Yennefer. 'His dream wish is being satisfied in his sleep. I probed his \n",
       "mind to the very depths. There wasn't much there. A few obscenities, several dreams and \n",
       "masses of poetry. But be that as it may. The seal which plugged the bottle with the djinn, \n",
       "Geralt, I know he doesn't have it. You do. Please give it to me.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What do you need the seal for?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'How should I answer your question?' The sorceress smiled coquettishly. 'Let's try this: it's \n",
       "none of your damned business, witcher. Does that satisfy you?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'No.' His smile was equally nasty. 'It doesn't. But don't reproach yourself for it, Yennefer. I'm \n",
       "not easily satisfied. Only those who are above average have managed so far.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Pity. So you'll remain unsatisfied. It's your loss. The seal, please. Don't pull that face, it \n",
       "doesn't suit either your good looks or your complexion. In case you hadn't noticed, let me tell \n",
       "you that you are now beginning to repay the gratitude you owe me. The seal is the first \n",
       "instalment for the price to be paid for the singer's voice.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I see you've divided the price into several instalments,' he said coldly. 'Fine. I might have \n",
       "expected that. But let it be a fair trade, Yennefer. I bought your help. And I'll pay.' \n",
       "\n",
       "She contorted her lips in a smile, but her violet eyes remained wide open and cold. \n",
       "\n",
       "'You shouldn't have any doubts as to that, witcher.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Me,' he repeated. 'Not Dandilion. I'm taking him to a safe place. When I've done that I'll come \n",
       "back and pay your second instalment, and all the others. Because as to the first . . .' \n",
       "\n",
       "He reached into a secret pocket of his belt and pulled out the brass seal with the sign of a star \n",
       "and broken cross. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Here, take it. Not as an instalment. Accept it from a witcher as proof of his gratitude for \n",
       "having treated him more kindly, albeit in a calculated manner, than the majority of your \n",
       "brethren would have done. Accept it as evidence of goodwill, which ought to convince you \n",
       "that, having seen to my friend's safety, I'll return to repay you. I didn't see the scorpion amidst \n",
       "the flowers, Yennefer. I'm prepared to pay for my inattention.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A pretty speech.' The sorceress folded her arms. 'Touching and pompous. Pity it's in vain. I \n",
       "need Dandilion, so he's staying here.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'He's already been close to the creature you intend to draw here.' Geralt indicated the patterns \n",
       "on the floor. 'When you've finished your handiwork and brought the djinn here Dandilion is \n",
       "most certainly going to suffer despite all your promises, maybe even more than before. \n",
       "Because it's the creature from the bottle that you want, isn't it? Do you intend to master it, \n",
       "force it to serve you? You don't have to answer, I know it's none of my damned business. Do \n",
       "what you want, draw ten demons in if you like. But without Dandilion. If you put him at risk, \n",
       "this will no longer be an honest trade, Yennefer, and you don't have the right to demand \n",
       "payment for that. I won't allow-' He broke off. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'I wondered when you'd feel it,' giggled the sorceress. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt tensed his muscles and, clenching his jaw until it hurt, strained his entire will. It didn't \n",
       "help. He was paralysed, like a \n",
       "\n",
       "stone statue, like a post which had been dug into the ground. He couldn't even wiggle a toe. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I knew you could deflect a spell thrown straight at you,' said Yennefer. 'I also knew that \n",
       "before you tried anything you'd try to impress me with your eloquence. You were talking \n",
       "while the spell hanging over you was working and slowly breaking you. Now you can only \n",
       "talk. But you don't have to impress me anymore. I know you're eloquent. Any further efforts \n",
       "in that direction will only spoil the effect.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Chireadan-' he said with an effort, still fighting the magical paralysis. 'Chireadan will realise \n",
       "that you're up to something. He'll soon work it out, suspect something any minute now, \n",
       "because he doesn't trust you, Yennefer. He hasn't trusted you from the start-' \n",
       "\n",
       "The sorceress swept her hand in a broad gesture. The walls of the chamber became blurred \n",
       "and took on a uniform dull grey appearance and colour. The door disappeared, the windows \n",
       "disappeared, even the dusty curtains and pictures on the wall, splattered with flies, vanished. \n",
       "\n",
       "'What if Chireadan does figure it out?' She grimaced maliciously. 'Is he going to run for help? \n",
       "Nobody will get through my barrier. But Chireadan's not going to run anywhere. He won't do \n",
       "anything against me. Anything. He's under my spell. No, it's not a question of black sorcery. I \n",

       "because of me. I could have stopped you in the street, overpowered you, not allowed- But I \n",
       "didn't. Because I was afraid that when the spell she'd cast on you had dispelled, you'd go back \n",

       "\n",
       "The bald man took a short swing and punched the witcher in the stomach. It didn't help to \n",
       "tense his muscles in defence. Geralt, catching his breath with an effort, looked at the buckle of \n",
       "his own belt for a while, then the guards hauled him up again. \n",

       "words. 'It's her and no one else,' continued Krepp. 'There's no question about it. Who, if not \n",
       "Yennefer, would want revenge upon Laurelnose?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Hehehe,' chuckled the mayor suddenly. 'That's the thing I'm least angry about. Laurelnose has \n",
       "been scheming against me; he's been after my office. And now the people aren't going to \n",
       "respect him. When they remember how he got it in the arse-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That's all it needs, Mr Neville, you to applaud the crime,' Krepp frowned. 'Let me remind you \n",
       "that had I not thrown an exorcism at the witcher, he would have raised his hand to strike me \n",
       "and the temple's majesty-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And that's because you spoke vilely about her in your sermons, Krepp. Even Berrant \n",
       "complained about you. But what's true is true. Do you hear that, you scoundrels?' The mayor \n",
       "turned to Geralt and Chireadan again. 'Nothing justifies what you've done! I don't intend to \n",
       "tolerate such things here! That's enough, now get on with it, tell me everything, tell me what \n",
       "you have for your defence, because if you don't, I swear by all the relics that I'll lead you such \n",
       "a dance as you won't forget to your dying day! Tell me everything, right now, as you would in \n",
       "a confessional!' \n",
       "\n",
       "Chireadan sighed deeply and looked meaningfully and pleadingly at the witcher. \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt also sighed, then cleared his throat. And he recounted everything. Well, almost \n",
       "everything. \n",
       "\n",
       "'So that's it,' said the priest after a moment's silence. 'A fine kettle of fish. A genie released \n",
       "from captivity. And an enchantress who has her sights on the genie. Not a bad arrangement. \n",
       "This could end badly, very badly.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What's a genie?' asked Neville. 'And what does this Yennefer want?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Enchanters,' explained Krepp, 'draw their power from the forces of nature, or to put it more \n",
       "accurately, from the so-called Four Elements or Principles, commonly called the natural \n",
       "forces. Air, Water, Fire and Earth. Each of these elements has its own Dimension which is \n",
       "called a Plane in the jargon used by enchanters. There's a Water Plane, Fire Plane and so on. \n",
       "These Dimensions, which are beyond our reach, are inhabited by what are called genies-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'That's what they're called in legends,' interrupted the witcher. 'Because as far as I know-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Don't interrupt,' Krepp cut him short. 'The fact that you don't know much was evident in your \n",
       "tale, witcher. So be quiet and listen to what those wiser than you have to say. Going back to \n",
       "the genies, there are four sorts, just as there are four Planes. Djinns are air creatures; marides \n",
       "are associated with the principle of water; afreet are Fire genies and d'ao, the genies of \n",
       "Earth-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You've run away with yourself, Krepp,' Neville butted in. 'This isn't a temple school, don't \n",
       "lecture us. Briefly, what does Yennefer want with this genie?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A genie like this, mayor, is a living reservoir of magical energy. A sorcerer who has a genie \n",
       "at their beck and call can direct that energy in the form of spells. They don't have to draw the \n",
       "Force from Nature, the genie does it for them. The power of such an enchanter is enormous, \n",
       "close to omnipotence-' \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "'Somehow I've never heard of a wizard who can do everything,' contradicted Neville. 'On the \n",
       "contrary, the power of most of them is clearly exaggerated. They can't do this, they can't-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'The enchanter Stammelford,' interrupted the priest, once more \n",
       "\n",
       "taking on the tone and poise of an academic lecturer, 'once moved a mountain because it \n",
       "obstructed the view from his tower. Nobody has managed to do the like, before or since. \n",
       "Because Stammelford, so they say, had the services of a d'ao, an Earth genie. There are \n",
       "records of deeds accomplished by other magicians on a similar scale. Enormous waves and \n",
       "catastrophic rains are certainly the work of marides. Fiery columns, fires and explosions the \n",
       "work of afreets-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Whirlwinds, hurricanes, flights above the earth,' muttered Geralt, 'Geoffrey Monck.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Exactly. I see you do know something after all.' Krepp glanced at him more kindly. 'Word has \n",
       "it old Monck had a way of forcing a djinn to serve him. There were rumours that he had more \n",
       "than one. He was said to keep them in bottles and make use of them when need arose. Three \n",
       "wishes from each genie, then it's free and escapes into its own dimension.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'The one at the river didn't fulfil anything,' said Geralt emphatically. 'He immediately threw \n",
       "himself at Dandilion's throat.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Genies,' Krepp turned up his nose, 'are spiteful and deceitful beings. They don't like being \n",
       "packed into bottles and ordered to move mountains. They do everything they possibly can to \n",
       "make it impossible for you to express your wishes and then they fulfil them in a way which is \n",
       "hard to control and foresee, sometimes literally, so you have to be careful what you say. To \n",
       "subjugate a genie you need a will of iron, nerves of steel, a strong Force and considerable \n",
       "abilities. From what you say, it looks like your abilities, witcher, were too modest.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Too modest to subjugate the cad,' agreed Geralt. 'But I did chase him away; he bolted so fast \n",
       "the air howled. And that's also something. Yennefer, it's true, ridiculed my exorcism-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What was the exorcism? Repeat it.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt repeated it, word for word. \n",
       "\n",
       "'What?!' The priest first turned pale, then red and finally blue. 'How dare you! Are you \n",
       "making fun of me?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Forgive me,' stuttered Geralt. 'To be honest, I don't know . . . what the words mean.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'So don't repeat what you don't know! I've no idea where you could have heard such filth!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Enough of that.' The mayor waved it all aside. 'We're wasting time. Right. We now know \n",
       "what the sorceress wants the genie for. But you said, Krepp, that it's bad. What's bad? Let her \n",
       "catch him and go to hell, what do I care? I think-' \n",
       "\n",
       "No one ever found out what Neville was thinking, even if it wasn't a boast. A luminous \n",
       "rectangle appeared on the wall next to the tapestry of Prophet Lebiodus, something flashed \n",
       "and Dandilion landed in the middle of the town hall. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Innocent!' yelled the poet in a clear, melodious tenor, sitting on the floor and looking around, \n",
       "his eyes vague. 'Innocent! The witcher is innocent! I wish you to believe it!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Dandilion!' Geralt shouted, holding Krepp back, who was clearly getting ready to perform an \n",
       "exorcism or a curse. 'Where have you . . . here . . . Dandilion!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Geralt!' The bard jumped up. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Dandilion!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Who's this?' Neville growled. 'Dammit, if you don't put an end to your spells, there's no \n",
       "guarantee what I'll do. I've said that spells are forbidden in Rinde! First you have to put in a \n",
       "written application, then pay a tax and stamp duty . . . Eh? Isn't it that singer, the witch's \n",
       "hostage?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Dandilion,' repeated Geralt, holding the poet by the shoulders. 'How did you get here?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I don't know,' admitted the bard with a foolish, worried expression. 'To be honest, I'm rather \n",
       "unaware of what happened to me. I don't remember much and may the plague take me if I \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "know what of that is real and what's a nightmare. But I do remember quite a pretty, black-\n",
       "haired female with fiery eyes-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What are you telling me about black-haired women for?' Neville interrupted angrily. 'Get to \n",
       "the point, squire, to the point. You yelled that the witcher is innocent. How am I to understand \n",
       "that? That Laurelnose thrashed his own arse with his hands? Because if the witcher's innocent, \n",
       "it couldn't have been otherwise. Unless it was a mass hallucination.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I don't know anything about any arses or hallucinations,' said Dandilion proudly. 'Or anything \n",
       "about laurel noses. I repeat, that the last thing I remember was an elegant woman dressed in \n",
       "tastefully co-ordinated black and white. She threw me into a shiny hole, a magic portal for \n",
       "sure. But first she gave me a clear and precise errand. As soon as I'd arrived I was \n",
       "immediately to say, I quote: \"My wish is for you to believe the witcher is not guilty for what \n",
       "occurred. That, and no other, is my wish.\" Word for word. Indeed, I tried to ask what all this \n",
       "was, what it was all about, and why. The black-haired woman didn't let me get a word in \n",
       "edgeways. She scolded me most inelegantly, grasped me by the neck and threw me into the \n",
       "portal. That's all. And now . . .' Dandilion pulled himself up, brushed his doublet, adjusted his \n",
       "collar and fancy - if dirty - ruffles. '. . . perhaps, gentlemen, you'd like to tell me the name of \n",
       "the best tavern in town and where it can be found.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'There are no bad taverns in my town,' said Neville slowly. 'But before you see them for \n",
       "yourself, you'll inspect the best dungeon in this town very thoroughly. You and your \n",
       "companions. Let me remind you that you're still not free, you scoundrels! Look at them! One \n",
       "tells incredible stories while the other leaps out of the wall and shouts about innocence, I \n",
       "wish, he yells, you to believe me. He has the audacity to wish-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'My gods!' the priest suddenly grasped his bald crown. 'Now I understand! The wish! The last \n",
       "wish!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'What's happened to you, Krepp?' the mayor frowned. 'Are you ill?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'The last wish!' repeated the priest. 'She made the bard express the last, the third wish. And \n",
       "Yennefer set a magical trap and, no doubt, captured the genie before he managed to escape \n",
       "into his own dimension! Mr Neville, we must-' \n",
       "\n",
       "It thundered outside. So strongly that the walls shook. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Dammit,' muttered the mayor, going up to the window. 'That was close. As long as it doesn't \n",
       "hit a house. All I need now is a fire- Oh gods! Just look! Just look at this! Krepp! What is \n",
       "it?' \n",
       "\n",
       "All of them, to a man, rushed to the window. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Mother of mine!' yelled Dandilion, grabbing his throat. 'It's him! It's that son-of-a-bitch who \n",
       "strangled me!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'The djinn!' shouted Krepp. 'The Air genie!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Above Errdil's tavern!' shouted Chireadan, 'above his roof!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'She's caught him!' The priest leant out so far he almost fell. 'Can you see the magical light? \n",
       "The sorceress has caught the genie!' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt watched in silence. \n",
       "\n",
       "Once, years ago, when a little snot-faced brat following his studies in Kaer Morhen, the \n",
       "Witchers' Settlement, he and a friend, Eskel, had captured a huge forest bumble-bee and tied it \n",
       "to a jug with a thread. They were in fits of laughter watching the antics of the tied bumble-\n",
       "bee, until Vesemir, their tutor, caught them at it and tanned their hides with a leather strap. \n",
       "\n",
       "The djinn, circling above the roof of Errdil's tavern, behaved exactly like that bumble-bee. He \n",
       "flew up and fell, he sprang up and dived, he buzzed furiously in a circle. Because the djinn, \n",
       "exactly like the bumble-bee in Kaer Morhen, was tied down. Twisted threads of blindingly \n",
       "bright light of various colours were tightly wrapped around him and ended at the roof. But the \n",
       "djinn had more options than the bumble-bee, which couldn't knock down surrounding roofs, \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "rip thatches to shreds, destroy chimneys, and shatter towers and garrets. The djinn could. And \n",
       "did. \n",
       "\n",
       "'It's destroying the town,' wailed Neville. 'That monster's destroying my town!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Hehehe,' laughed the priest. 'She's found her match, it seems! It's an exceptionally strong \n",
       "djinn! I really don't know who's caught whom, the witch him or he the witch! Ha, it'll end \n",
       "with the djinn grinding her to dust. Very good! Justice will be done!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I shit on justice!' yelled the mayor, not caring if there were any voters under the window. \n",
       "'Look what's happening there, Krepp! Panic, ruin! You didn't tell me that, you bald idiot! You \n",
       "played the wise guy, gabbled on, but not a word about what's most important! Why didn't you \n",
       "tell me that that demon . . . Witcher! Do something! Do you hear, innocent sorcerer? Do \n",
       "something about that demon! I forgive you all your offences, but-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'There's nothing can be done here, Mr Neville,' snorted Krepp. 'You didn't listen to what I was \n",
       "saying, that's all. You never listen to me. This, I repeat, is an exceptionally strong djinn. If it \n",
       "wasn't for that, the sorceress would have hold of him already. Her spell is soon going to \n",
       "weaken, and then the djinn is going to crush her and escape. And we'll have some peace.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'And in the meantime, the town will go to ruins?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'We've got to wait,' repeated the priest, 'but not idly. Give out the orders, mayor. Tell the \n",
       "people to evacuate the surrounding houses and get ready to extinguish fires. What's happening \n",
       "there now is nothing compared to the hell that's going to break loose when the genie has \n",
       "finished with the witch.' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt raised his head, caught Chireadan's eye and looked away. \n",
       "\n",
       "'Mr Krepp,' he suddenly decided, 'I need your help. It's about the portal through which \n",
       "Dandilion appeared here. The portal still links the town hall to-' \n",
       "\n",
       "'There's not even a trace of the portal anymore,' the priest said coldly, pointing to the wall. \n",
       "'Can't you see?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'A portal leaves a trace, even when invisible. A spell can stabilise such a trace. I'll follow it.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'You must be mad. Even if a passage like that doesn't tear you to pieces, what do you expect \n",
       "to gain by it? Do you want to find yourself in the middle of a cyclone?' \n",
       "\n",
       "'I asked if you can cast a spell which could stabilise the trace.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Spell?' the priest proudly raised his head. 'I'm not a godless sorcerer! I don't cast spells! My \n",
       "power comes from faith and prayer!' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Can you or can't you?' \n",
       "\n",

       "strangled' \n",
       "\n",
       "'Silence, please,' said Krepp, 'and gravity. I'm praying.' \n",
       "\n",
       "'To hell with your prayers!' Neville hollered. 'I'm off to gather the people. We've got to do \n",
       "something and not stand here gabbling! Gods, what a day! What a bloody day!' \n",
       "\n",
       "The witcher felt Chireadan touch his shoulder. He turned. The elf looked him in the eyes, then \n",
       "lowered his own. \n",
       "\n",
       "'You're going there because you have to, aren't you?' \n",
       "\n",
       "Geralt hesitated. He thought he smelled the scent of lilac and gooseberries. \n",
       "\n",
       "'I think so,' he said reluctantly. 'I do have to. I'm sorry, Chireadan-' \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",

       "the barely visible outline on the wall. 'But the portal is unsteady and won't stay there for long. \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",

       "eardrums.' \n",

       "hands in the air, creating a pulsating aura around himself. 'I'll spread some protection, just in \n",
       "case. And if the portal does burst . . . I'll try and pull you out, witcher. What are eardrums to \n",

       "\n",
       "The floor shook. At first he thought he was trembling after his journey through the splitting \n",

       "trembling and creaking. \n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "He saw her. She was kneeling between tables, bent over the magical sphere. The sphere was \n",
       "aflame with a strong, milky light, so bright, enough to shine red through her fingers. The light \n",
       "from the sphere illuminated a scene, flickering and swaying, but clear. Geralt saw the small \n",
       "room with a star and pentagram traced on the floor, blazing with white heat. He saw many-\n",
       "coloured, creaking, fiery lines shooting from the pentagram and disappearing up over the roof \n",
